# Front-End CI Fixes – TypeScript Configuration  
*(feature/api-contract-unification branch)*  

This note documents exactly what was changed to unblock the **“build-and-test / type-check”** job in the AquaMind-Frontend GitHub Action.

---

## 1 Problem

After regenerating the OpenAPI client the CI job failed with 11 TypeScript errors such as:

* `Private identifiers are only available when targeting ECMAScript 2015 and higher`
* `Type 'Set<string>' can only be iterated through when using the '--downlevelIteration' flag`
* `Property 'Authorization' does not exist on type 'Headers | Resolver<Headers>'`

These errors indicated that the compiler target was too old and that `lib` / `downlevelIteration` flags were missing.  
The auto-generated `CancelablePromise.ts` (private fields `#isCancelled`) and code that spreads a `Set` required **ES2015+** emit.

---

## 2 Fix Applied (tsconfig.json)

| Compiler Option | Old | New | Reason |
|-----------------|-----|-----|--------|
| `target` | _undefined_ (default ES3) | **"ES2020"** | Enables private class fields, `Promise`, `Set`, etc. |
| `lib` | `["dom"]` | **`["esnext", "dom", "dom.iterable"]`** | Pulls in modern built-ins used by generated client |
| `downlevelIteration` | _false_ | **true** | Allows `for…of`, spread (`...`) on `Set`/`Map` when emitting ES5 for tests |
| _(unchanged)_ `module` | `"ESNext"` | — | Still aligned with Vite/ESM build |
| _(unchanged)_ `noEmit` | `true` | — | CI only type-checks |

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json (excerpt)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true,
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["esnext", "dom", "dom.iterable"],
    "downlevelIteration": true,
    // …
  }
}
```

---

## 3 Additional Code Tweaks

1. **`client/src/api/index.ts`**  
   • Replaced destructuring of `Authorization` from `OpenAPI.HEADERS` with a safe object copy to silence  
   `Property 'Authorization' does not exist on type 'Headers | Resolver<Headers>'`.

2. **No source changes** were needed in generated client files or `BatchFeedHistoryView.tsx`; the new `tsconfig.json` options resolved those errors automatically.

---

## 4 Result

| Job | Before | After |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `build-and-test / type-check` | ❌ 11 TS errors | ✅ 0 errors |
| `Report contract validation status` | ❌ failed | ✅ passes |

The frontend pipeline is now green and ready for merge.  
If future generated code introduces modern syntax, ensure **`target` ≥ ES2020** remains in sync with Vite build settings.
