# AquaMind Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Frontend development effort** for a web-based aquaculture management system built with React and TypeScript. This is **NOT the full application** - it's a frontend prototype using stubbed backend APIs to validate UX/UI concepts and integration patterns before merging with the actual Django backend system.

The application focuses on monitoring fish farms, tracking mortality, and providing analytics for aquaculture operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (server state) + Zustand (recommended for client state)
- **Stub Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript (for frontend development only)
- **Target Backend**: Django (the actual production system)
- **Mock Database**: In-memory storage with Drizzle ORM schemas (matching Django models)
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **Deployment**: Replit (frontend prototype only)

## Current Architecture
- Responsive web application (mobile-friendly, not native mobile app)
- Desktop dashboard for management + mobile-optimized forms for field workers
- **Stubbed RESTful API** with Express backend serving mock data that mimics Django API structure
- Component-based architecture with shadcn/ui design system
- **Integration Strategy**: Frontend branch will be merged with actual Django backend once UI/UX is validated

## Session Log

### Session 1 - Initial Setup & Mortality Reporting Feature

**Date**: Current session

**Accomplished**:
1. ✅ **Technology Stack Analysis**
   - Confirmed React + TypeScript frontend framework
   - Identified Chart.js for data visualization
   - Reviewed state management approach (TanStack Query + recommended Zustand addition)

2. ✅ **Mobile Strategy Decision**
   - Decided to keep current web app approach (responsive design)
   - Mobile workers will use browser-based forms on phones
   - Avoided separate native mobile app to reduce complexity

3. ✅ **Mortality Reporting Feature Implementation**
   - Created new mortality reporting page (`mortality-reporting.tsx`)
   - Added navigation route in App.tsx
   - Updated sidebar with new menu item
   - Installed `@hookform/resolvers` dependency
   - Built mobile-optimized form for field workers to record:
     - Dead fish count
     - Probable cause (wounds, predation, disease, other)
     - Location (farm site and sea pen)
     - Date/time of observation
     - Additional notes

4. ✅ **Form Validation & UX**
   - Implemented Zod schema validation
   - Used React Hook Form for form management
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Mobile-responsive design for field use

**Current Status**: 
- Basic mortality reporting feature implemented
- Form validation working
- Need to fix Select component error (empty value prop issue)
- Ready for backend API integration

**Next Steps Identified**:
- Fix Select component value prop error in mortality reporting form
- Implement backend API endpoints for mortality data
- Add Zustand for complex client state management (user roles, permissions)
- Consider Windows AD integration for enterprise deployment
- Add more field worker personas and use cases
- Implement offline-first capabilities for field data collection

## Notes
- Project is in early development phase with fluid requirements
- Focus on simple, mobile-friendly interfaces for field workers
- Backend currently serves mock data - needs real database integration
- Consider multiple simple apps for different personas rather than one complex dashboard
