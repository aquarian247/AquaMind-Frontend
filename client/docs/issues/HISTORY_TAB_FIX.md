# History Tab Empty - Root Cause & Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

### **Problem 1: Filter Logic Broken**
The filter was comparing an **object** to a **number**:

```typescript
// WRONG:
assignments.filter((a: any) => a.batch === batchId)
// Comparing {id: 206, batch_number: "..."} === 206  ← Always FALSE!
```

**API Returns**:
```json
{
  "batch": {
    "id": 206,           ← Object, not just ID!
    "batch_number": "SCO-2024-001"
  }
}
```

### **Problem 2: Pagination - Only 20 of 60 Assignments**
The code was fetching **only page 1** (20 results) instead of all 60 assignments:

```typescript
// WRONG: Only gets first page
const response = await ApiService.apiV1BatchContainerAssignmentsList(
  ...,
  undefined, // page ← Gets page 1 only!
  ...
);
// Result: 60 total, but only 20 returned
```

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Correct Filter Logic**
```typescript
// AFTER: Handle nested batch object
const batchAssignments = assignments.filter((a: any) => 
  (typeof a.batch === 'object' ? a.batch?.id : a.batch) === batchId
);
```

**Handles both cases**:
- ✅ If `batch` is object: Compare `batch.id` with `batchId`
- ✅ If `batch` is number: Compare `batch` with `batchId`

### **Fix 2: Fetch ALL Pages**
```typescript
// AFTER: Use api helper that fetches all pages automatically
const { data: assignmentsResponse } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["batch/assignments/all-pages", batchId],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await api.batch.getAssignments(batchId);
    // This helper fetches ALL pages (60 total, not just 20)
    return response;
  },
});

const assignments = assignmentsResponse?.results || [];
```

**Result**: Gets all 60 assignments across 3 pages

### **Fix 3: Same for Transfers and Mortality**
Applied the same nested object handling to:
- ✅ Transfers filter
- ✅ Mortality events filter

### **Fix 4: Growth Samples Field Name**
```typescript
// Growth samples use 'assignment' not 'containerAssignment'
const batchGrowthSamples = growthSamples?.filter((s: any) => 
  batchAssignments.some((a: any) => a.id === s.assignment)
) || [];
```

## 📊 **API Response Structures**

### **Assignment**:
```json
{
  "id": 5456,
  "batch": { "id": 206, "batch_number": "SCO-2024-001" },
  "container": { "id": 583, "name": "S-SEA-01-Ring-13" },
  "lifecycle_stage": { "id": 6, "name": "Adult" },
  "population_count": 244074,
  "is_active": true
}
```

### **Growth Sample**:
```json
{
  "id": 100553,
  "assignment": 5456,  ← Just the ID, not nested
  "avg_weight_g": "1415.96"
}
```

### **Transfer**:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "batch": { "id": 206, "batch_number": "..." },  ← Nested
  "transfer_type": "MOVE"
}
```

## 🧪 **Expected Results After Fix**

Refresh browser and navigate to Batch 206 → History tab:

### **Container Assignments subtab**:
- ✅ Should show table with **60 rows** (10 active + 50 inactive)
- ✅ Each row shows container, stage, population, biomass, dates
- ✅ Status badges: "Active" (green) or "Departed" (gray)

### **Transfer History subtab**:
- ✅ Should show transfer records (if any exist)
- ✅ Transfer dates, populations, container names

### **Growth Analysis subtab**:
- ✅ Should show growth chart with data points
- ✅ Weight progression from 0.14g to 1415.96g
- ✅ 690 samples (paginated, showing first 20)

### **Lifecycle Progression subtab**:
- ✅ Should show bar charts by stage
- ✅ Population and biomass distribution

### **Mortality Events subtab**:
- ✅ Should show 5720 total mortality events
- ✅ Table with dates, counts, causes

## 📝 **Console Logs to Watch**

After refresh, console should show:
```
✅ Assignments fetched (ALL PAGES): { total: 60, resultsLength: 60, ... }
🔍 FILTERED BATCH DATA: { batchAssignments: 60, batchTransfers: X, ... }
```

**Key change**: 
- Before: `batchAssignments: 0` ❌
- After: `batchAssignments: 60` ✅

---

## 🎯 **Files Modified**

- `components/batch-management/BatchTraceabilityView.tsx`
  - Added import for `api` helper
  - Changed to use `api.batch.getAssignments()` (fetches all pages)
  - Fixed filter logic to handle nested batch objects
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout
  - Fixed growth samples field name (`assignment` not `containerAssignment`)
