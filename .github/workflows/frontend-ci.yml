    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Contract enforcement – ensure every endpoint used in the codebase
    # exists in the backend OpenAPI specification.  The spec should have
    # been copied into ./api/openapi.yaml by the sync-openapi workflow.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # NOTE: During Phase 1 we only WARN on failures so the pipeline keeps
    # moving.  Once legacy endpoints are removed in Phase 2 the guard can
    # be made blocking again (remove `continue-on-error` and `|| true`).
