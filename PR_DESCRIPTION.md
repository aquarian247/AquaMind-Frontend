## 🎨 Key Features

### Established Patterns (10 total)
1. **Simple Entity** - Basic forms with validation
2. **FK Dropdown** - Relationship management with query caching
3. **Enum Dropdown** - Type-safe enum handling
4. **XOR Logic** - Conditional relationships (hall OR area)
5. **Cascading Filters** - Multi-level drill-down (Geography → Station → Hall → Container)
6. **Date Pickers** - Accessible date selection
7. **Permission Gates** - RBAC with 7 roles (Viewer → Super Admin)
8. **Audit Trails** - Required change reasons on all deletes
9. **Multi-Step Wizards** - Complex flows (Batch Creation, Health Sampling)
10. **Dynamic Rows** - Repeatable sections (Observations, Assignments)

### Cross-Cutting Features
- **Permission System**: WriteGate & DeleteGate with 7 roles
- **Audit Trail Capture**: Required reasons on all deletions (min 10 chars)
- **Validation Library**: 37 Zod schemas with comprehensive field validation
- **Toast Notifications**: Consistent success/error feedback (Sonner)
- **Query Invalidation**: Automatic cache refresh after mutations
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light modes with CSS variables
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layouts throughout

## 🔒 Compliance & Security

### Backend Audit Trail (100% compliance)
All 8 domains verified using `AUDIT_TRAIL_VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md`:
- ✅ Infrastructure (8 models, 8 viewsets)
- ✅ Batch (6 models, 6 viewsets)
- ✅ Inventory (4 models, 4 viewsets)
- ✅ Health (7 models, 7 viewsets) - Fixed during Phase 4
- ✅ Environmental (2 models, 2 viewsets) - Reinstated during Phase 5
- ✅ Users (1 model, 1 viewset)
- ✅ Scenario (5 models, 7 viewsets) - Fixed during Phase 7
- ✅ Broodstock (10 models, 11 viewsets)

**Exception**: Scenario model history intentionally excluded to prevent 50GB+ table bloat

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- 285+ ARIA attributes across 55 files
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility (`useAccessibility` hook)
- Focus management and skip links
- Accessible error messages and loading states

---

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- ✅ GUI smoke tests for all 8 phases
- ✅ All 27 forms tested with valid/invalid inputs
- ✅ Permission gates tested with different roles
- ✅ Delete workflows with audit reason capture
- ✅ Cascading filters and relationships verified
- ✅ Keyboard navigation on all forms
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility (VoiceOver)
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop

### Automated Testing
- ✅ Validation schema tests (86 tests)
- ✅ Permission system tests (41 tests)
- ✅ Audit trail tests (19 tests)
- ✅ Accessibility hook tests (19 tests)
- ✅ Component rendering tests (RTL)
- ✅ Backend integration tests (1083 passing)

## 🔧 Recent Fixes (Phase 8 Final)

### TypeScript Error Resolution (21 errors fixed)
1. **Temperature Model**: Updated to use `day_number` instead of `reading_date` (backend scenario fix)
2. **Audit Trail**: Removed FeedStock and Scenario history (endpoints not exposed)
3. **FeedStock Removal**: Updated to use FeedContainerStock (FIFO model)
4. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed health form, area summary, batch parameters
5. **Auth Fix**: TemperatureDataView now uses ApiService (automatic JWT)
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling for domains with no history endpoints

All changes accommodate backend migrations and maintain contract-first alignment.
