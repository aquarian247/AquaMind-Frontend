### Overall Project MI: **62** (Moderate Maintainability)

**Critical Issues:**
- 3 components with MI < 50 (Poor maintainability)
- Complex domain logic concentrated in large files
- High coupling between UI and business logic

## 5. Cognitive Complexity Analysis

### High Cognitive Load Components

#### ScenarioPlanning.tsx
- **Cognitive Complexity:** ~55
- **Factors:**
  - Deep nesting in JSX rendering (5+ levels)
  - Complex conditional logic for different scenario types
  - Multiple state management patterns
  - Extensive API orchestration

#### BroodstockDashboard.tsx
- **Cognitive Complexity:** ~60
- **Factors:**
  - Complex chart configuration logic
  - Multiple data transformation pipelines
  - Nested conditional rendering for different view modes
  - Genetic analysis calculations

#### BatchManagement.tsx
- **Cognitive Complexity:** ~45
- **Factors:**
  - Complex form validation with cross-field dependencies
  - Lifecycle state management
  - Container assignment logic

**Interpretation:** These components exceed recommended cognitive complexity thresholds (>15), making them difficult for developers to understand and modify safely.

- **Impact:** Difficult state debugging, potential race conditions
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Recommendation:** Consider useReducer or state management library

#### 3. Inline Business Logic
- **Issue:** Complex calculations embedded in JSX
- **Impact:** Poor testability, code duplication
- **Priority:** High
- **Recommendation:** Extract to custom hooks or utility functions

#### 4. API Response Type Inconsistency
- **Issue:** Mixed use of generated types and inline interfaces
- **Impact:** Type safety issues, maintenance overhead
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Recommendation:** Standardize on generated API types

| **File Size** | < 500 LOC | ❌ Exceeds in 5 files |
| **Cognitive Complexity** | < 15 per function | ❌ Exceeds in 3 components |
| **Maintainability Index** | > 65 | ❌ Below in 3 components |
| **Test Coverage** | > 80% | ⚠️ Not measured |

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Weekly:** Monitor complexity metrics for new/modified files

## 11. Conclusion

The AquaMind Frontend demonstrates sophisticated domain expertise but suffers from complexity concentration in key business logic components. While the overall architecture is sound, immediate attention is required for the three largest components to prevent further technical debt accumulation.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Modern technology stack
- ✅ Good component reusability in UI layer
- ✅ Effective API abstraction
- ✅ Comprehensive feature coverage

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ High complexity in domain components
- ❌ Large file sizes impacting maintainability
- ❌ Limited component testing
- ❌ Inconsistent state management patterns

**Overall Assessment:** The project is in a **moderate maintainability** state with **high business value** but requires **immediate refactoring** of critical components to ensure long-term sustainability.
