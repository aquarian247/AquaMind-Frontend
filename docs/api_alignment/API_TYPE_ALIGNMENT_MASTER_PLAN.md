# API Type Alignment Master Plan  
_AquaMind-Frontend ‚Üî Backend ‚Ä¢ Contract-Strict Initiative_  

---

## 1 Purpose & Context  
The backend OpenAPI specification is frozen and **the single source of truth**.  
All TypeScript errors in the frontend originate from diverging local DTOs, camelCase props, and legacy endpoints.  
This plan orchestrates a multi-phase, strictly typed alignment so that:

* `npm run type-check` exits **0**.  
* No local DTOs exist; only generated types are used.  
* CI endpoint validator is re-enabled as blocking.  

Progress is event-driven (phases), not time-based, optimised for Code Droid execution.

## 2 Phases & Exit Criteria  

| Phase | Goal | Mandatory Exit Criteria | Blocking Issues* |
|-------|------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **P0 ‚Äì Type Purge** | Remove duplicate local DTOs | ‚Ä¢ `client/src/lib/types/django.ts` deleted  <br>‚Ä¢ Build compiles (may still error) | #P0 |
| **P1 ‚Äì Snake_Case Adoption** | Replace camelCase props | ‚Ä¢ No camelCase property references in `src/`  <br>‚Ä¢ Type errors linked to case mismatch = 0 | #P1 |
| **P2 ‚Äì Query Fix-up** | All components fetch via `ApiService` | ‚Ä¢ No hard-coded `/api` strings (lint pass)  <br>‚Ä¢ All wrong service names corrected | #P2 |
| **P3 ‚Äì Client Aggregations** | Compute missing props locally | ‚Ä¢ Hooks / selectors derive KPIs  <br>‚Ä¢ Type errors count = 0 | #P3 |
| **P4 ‚Äì Reliability Gate** | Lock contract | ‚Ä¢ `npm run type-check` & `validate:endpoints` **blocking** in CI  <br>‚Ä¢ Pre-commit hook prevents local DTOs | #11 #12 #21 #22 |

\* ‚ÄúBlocking Issues‚Äù column lists the GitHub issue that must be closed to mark the phase complete.

## 3 Progress Tracker  

_Code Droids update this table at the end of every session._

| Phase | Status | Started At | Completed At | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| P0 | ‚úÖ | 2025-08-19 | 2025-08-19 | Deleted client/src/lib/types/django.ts; no active imports referenced it; type-check clean |
| P1 | ‚úÖ | 2025-08-19 | 2025-08-19 | Snake_case adoption enforced in BatchHealthView & BatchAnalyticsView (tests & mocks), BatchContainerView pagination types fixed; all tests green; type-check 0 |
| P2 | ‚òê | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| P3 | ‚òê | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| P4 | ‚òê | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |

### Phase P1 ‚Äì Session Notes (2025-08-19)

* Updated BatchHealthView and BatchAnalyticsView test suites to use `/api/v1/*` endpoints with paginated `results` arrays and snake_case fields.  
* Aligned BatchAnalyticsView queries (growth, feeding, environmental, scenarios, assignments) to `ApiService` v1 methods; added computed fall-backs where required.  
* Adjusted assertions to match component error / empty states and resolved duplicate-text query issues.  
* Verified: `npm run type-check` passes with **0** errors; `npm test` ‚Äì **all green** (31 tests).

## PR Strategy

- Create a new draft PR per phase on a fresh branch `type-alignment/<phase>`.
- Base from `develop` if it exists; otherwise base from `main`.
- Do not reuse older failing alignment PRs. After a phase merges, rebase or cherry-pick any related open PRs onto the updated base.

## 4 Work Instructions for Code Droids  

1. **Checkout branch** `type-alignment/<phase>` (create if missing).  
2. Read ‚ÄúRequired Reading‚Äù list in the corresponding GitHub issue.  
3. Complete tasks listed under **‚ÄúAction Steps‚Äù** in that issue.  
4. Run `npm run type-check`.  
5. Update the _Progress Tracker_ table above.  
6. `git add -A && git commit -m "phase <X>: <summary>"`  
7. Push branch; reference the issue in commit message (`Fixes #<num>` where applicable).  
8. Post a comment summarising what changed + remaining errors.  
9. Stop work when:  
   ‚Ä¢ Phase exit criteria satisfied **or**  
   ‚Ä¢ Remaining errors > 0 but need human decision ‚Üí comment & await feedback.

## 5 Issue Index & Order of Execution  

| ID | Title | Phase | Required Reading |
|----|-------|-------|------------------|
| `#P0` | Delete duplicate DTO file & re-wire imports | P0 | `docs/FRONTEND_ADAPTATION_PRINCIPLES.md`, `docs/code_organization_guidelines.md` |
| `#P1` | Replace camelCase property references | P1 | Same as above |
| `#P2` | Migrate all network calls to ApiService | P2 | `docs/architecture.md` (query layer), `api/openapi.yaml` |
| `#P3` | Implement client-side aggregations & remove residual TS errors | P3 | Component-specific docs noted inside issue |
| `#11` | Make CI endpoint validation blocking | P4 | Existing issue |
| `#12` | Documentation final pass & contract freeze | P4 | Existing issue |
| `#21` | Add frontend-backend integration tests | P4 | Existing issue |
| `#22` | Add pre-commit hooks for API validation | P4 | Existing issue |

_Backend FCR investigation is separate (`AquaMind` repo) and not part of the type alignment critical path._

## 6 Session Checklist  

At the end of **every** Code Droid session:

- [ ] All automated tests & `npm run type-check` executed locally  
- [ ] Progress Tracker table updated  
- [ ] Commit & push to branch  
- [ ] GitHub issue comment posted with:  
  - Summary of changes  
  - Remaining errors / blockers  
  - Next recommended action  

If phase exit criteria are satisfied, close the phase issue and ping the next phase assignee.
