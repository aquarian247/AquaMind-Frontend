# AquaMind Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Comprehensive aquaculture management system** built with React and TypeScript for Bakkafrost salmon farming operations in the Faroe Islands and Scotland. The application provides enterprise-level monitoring, inventory management, environmental tracking, and analytics for fish farm operations.

The system focuses on FIFO inventory management, real-time monitoring, mortality tracking, and comprehensive analytics for large-scale aquaculture operations.

### Critical Data Integrity Principle
**All GUI fields, metrics, and aggregations must reflect actual API capabilities.** Never invent, mock, or display data that cannot be retrieved from the existing API endpoints. This ensures the frontend accurately represents real system capabilities and prevents misleading users about available functionality. All displayed values should be derived from actual API responses or calculated from authentic data sources.

## Technology Stack

- **State Management**: TanStack Query (server state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript serving RESTful APIs
- **Database**: In-memory storage with Drizzle ORM schemas (production-ready structure)
- **Charts**: Chart.js with responsive design
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui design system with full accessibility
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with touch-optimized interfaces
- **Theming**: Multi-theme system with light/dark mode support
- **Deployment**: Replit with auto-deployment capabilities

## Current Architecture
- **Fully responsive web application** optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Mobile-first design** with hamburger navigation and touch-friendly interfaces
- **Comprehensive FIFO inventory system** with 7 specialized management sections
- **Real-time dashboard** with KPI monitoring and alert systems

## Mobile Responsiveness Best Practices

### What's Mobile-Friendly by Default ✅
The system has been built with mobile-first design principles, so most new features will automatically work well on mobile:

1. **Navigation System**: The hamburger menu system (in `client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`) automatically handles new menu items - just add them to the `NavigationMenu` component and they'll appear in both desktop sidebar and mobile drawer.

2. **Layout System**: The app uses Tailwind CSS with responsive classes throughout, so standard layouts will adapt automatically.

3. **UI Components**: All Shadcn/ui components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.) are already responsive and touch-friendly.

4. **Theme Support**: New pages automatically inherit the multi-theme system and dark/light mode support.

### What Needs Special Attention ⚠️
When adding new features, developers should consider:

1. **Data Tables**: Need horizontal scroll on mobile (like existing inventory tables)
2. **Complex Forms**: May need mobile-specific layouts with stacked fields instead of side-by-side
3. **Charts/Graphs**: Need to be responsive and touch-friendly (existing Chart.js implementations are good examples)
4. **Modal Dialogs**: Should be full-screen or near-full-screen on mobile devices

### Development Guidelines 📱
For new features to maintain mobile compatibility:

- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Use component patterns from inventory and dashboard pages
- **Test Mobile Breakpoint**: Test with the mobile breakpoint (`MOBILE_BREAKPOINT = 768` from `use-mobile.tsx`)
- **Responsive Grid Patterns**: Follow the established responsive grid patterns
- **Consistent Spacing**: Use existing spacing and sizing conventions
- **Touch-Friendly Interfaces**: Ensure buttons and interactive elements are touch-friendly
