## Audit Trail Frontend ‚Äì Overview and Detail Pages (Implementation Plan)

### Scope and goals

- Build a first-class Audit Trail experience with a left-menu entry, a responsive overview page with tabs (and optional sub-tabs), and record detail pages.
- Consume the existing history endpoints documented in the OpenAPI spec and integration guide; no client-side aggregation beyond what‚Äôs necessary for pagination/filters.
- Strictly adhere to the design system and page composition patterns used by other top-level modules (Batch, Infrastructure, Inventory, Health, Scenario).
- Always render honest fallbacks when data is absent: ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo Data Available‚Äù (never hardcoded or misleading values).
- Single feature branch for the whole implementation; one PR at the end of implementation.

### Assumptions

- Backend endpoints are available and documented; TypeScript client is generated from `api/openapi.yaml`.
- No audit trail seed data exists initially; UI must handle empty results gracefully.
- Authentication uses the canonical JWT endpoints and the app-wide auth configuration.

### High-level UI

- Left Nav: ‚ÄúAudit Trail‚Äù (top-level, consistent with other modules)
- Overview Page: Tabs by app domain with common filters
  - Tabs: Batch, Infrastructure, Inventory, Health, Scenario, Users
  - Within each tab: model selector (dropdown) when multiple models exist
  - Filters: Date range, Change type (+, ~, -), Username (icontains), Page size
  - Results: Paginated table with Date, User, Type (badge), Entity/Model summary, Reason, Actions (View details)
- Detail Page: Record snapshot and change context
  - Header: Timestamp, User, Type, Reason
  - Body: Field/value snapshot; best-effort before/after comparison when possible; fallback to snapshot-only with ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for unknowns
  - Secondary info: Model name, record id; links to related entities when available

## Tasks (single-session sized) ‚Äì one feature branch, one PR at the end

Each task includes: a minimal reading list, implementation steps, quality checks, and deliverables.

**üìù PLAN REVISION NOTE (2025-09-15)**: Task 4 was revised to eliminate redundancy with Task 2. The original Task 4 was reimplementing tab navigation and basic components already completed in Task 2. Task 4 now focuses on data integration and refinement instead of component creation.

### Task 0 (Optional but recommended): Minimal backend seed for audit events ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- Purpose: Provide a handful of real audit trail records in dev to visually validate UI.
- Reading list (short):
  - Backend repo: `apps/*/api/viewsets` to identify safe models for seed ops
  - Backend scripts: `AquaMind/scripts/data_generation` (patterns)
- Steps:
  - Add a backend management command or script to create/update/delete 30‚Äì50 records across 3‚Äì4 models (e.g., Batch, Infrastructure Area, Infrastructure Freshwater Station, Inventory), by 2-3 test users, so history events are emitted.
  - Run locally to confirm a few history records exist.
- Quality checks:
  - Verify endpoints return non-empty `results` in dev.
  - No schema or spectacular warnings introduced.
- Deliverable:
  - Simple backend command (referenced here; lives in backend repo), and brief note in this plan with run command.

**‚úÖ COMPLETED: Created `generate_audit_trail_data` management command**
- Command: `python manage.py generate_audit_trail_data --force`
- Location: `apps/infrastructure/management/commands/generate_audit_trail_data.py`
- Generated: 30+ history records across Geography, Area, FreshwaterStation, Batch, Feed, and JournalEntry models
- Users: Created 3 test users (audit_user1, audit_user2, audit_admin) for history attribution
- Verification: Confirmed history records exist (Geography: 10 history records, Batch: 20 history records)

### Task 1: Sync OpenAPI and verify history endpoints ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- Reading list:
  - `docs/audit-trail-frontend-integration-guide.md`
  - `README.md` (OpenAPI sync section)
  - `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (contract-first, generated client)
- Steps:
  - Run `npm run sync:openapi`.
  - Confirm presence of generated history methods, e.g., `ApiService.listBatchBatchHistory`, `ApiService.retrieveBatchBatchHistoryDetail`, etc.
  - Note supported filters: `date_from`, `date_to`, `history_user`, `history_type`, `page`, `page_size`.
- Quality checks:
  - TypeScript build passes: `npm run type-check`.
  - No unresolved imports in `client/src/api/generated`.
- Deliverable:
  - Short checklist added to this doc confirming generated methods exist.

**‚úÖ COMPLETED: Generated history methods verified**
- ‚úÖ `npm run sync:openapi` - Successfully synced OpenAPI spec and regenerated API client
- ‚úÖ History methods confirmed present:
  - `listBatchBatchHistory()` - Batch history list endpoint
  - `retrieveBatchBatchHistoryDetail(historyId)` - Batch history detail endpoint
  - `listInfrastructureAreaHistory()` - Infrastructure area history
  - `listHealthJournalEntryHistory()` - Health journal entry history
  - `listInventoryFeedStockHistory()` - Inventory feed stock history
  - `listScenarioScenarioHistory()` - Scenario history
  - `listUsersUserProfileHistory()` - User profile history
- ‚úÖ Supported filters confirmed: `date_from`, `date_to`, `history_user`, `history_type`, `page`

    - `components/` (FilterBar, HistoryTable, EmptyState, TypeBadge, ModelSelector)
    - `pages/OverviewPage.tsx`, `pages/RecordDetailPage.tsx`
    - `index.ts` (barrel for router lazy import)
  - Add "Audit Trail" to left navigation using the same pattern as existing top-level modules.
- Quality checks:
  - Files follow naming/size limits; no unused exports.
  - Route is reachable under `/audit-trail`.
- Deliverable:
  - Feature skeleton renders a placeholder page without errors.

## Definition of Done (per task)

- Code follows feature slice, naming, and size limits.
- Uses generated ApiService (no ad-hoc fetch) unless explicitly justified.
- Handles empty/error/loading with honest fallbacks (N/A, No Data Available).
- Passes type-check, lint, and tests.
- UI matches existing top-level modules‚Äô layout and spacing.
- Accessible and responsive.

---

## Test plan for Product Owner (manual)

Prereqs: Backend running (`VITE_USE_DJANGO_API=true`) and you are logged in. If no audit data exists, expect empty states.

1) Navigate to ‚ÄúAudit Trail‚Äù in left menu.
2) Overview Page renders with tabs: Batch, Infrastructure, Inventory, Health, Scenario, Users.
3) Select Batch tab ‚Üí Model dropdown defaults to the most common model; table appears.
   - If no data: page shows ‚ÄúNo Data Available‚Äù and filter controls are visible.
4) Apply filters:
   - Date range (last 7 days), Change type ‚Äú~‚Äù, Username contains ‚Äúadmin‚Äù.
   - Table updates and shows total count; pagination works.
5) Open a record via ‚ÄúView details‚Äù.
   - Detail Page shows timestamp, user, type badge, reason (or N/A).
   - Snapshot fields render; long values wrap on mobile.
6) Switch to another tab (e.g., Infrastructure) and repeat quick checks.
7) Resize browser to narrow width (<640px):
   - FilterBar stacks nicely; table scrolls horizontally if needed.
8) Error simulation (optional via devtools or test build):
   - Verify a clear, accessible error message is rendered (no raw stack traces).

Expected: No hardcoded values; where a field is unknown, N/A is displayed. Filters and tabs are keyboard navigable.

---

## Branch and PR

- Use a single implementation branch for all tasks (example: `feature/audit-trail-ui`).
- Open one PR when all tasks are complete. Ensure it includes:
  - Screenshots (desktop and mobile)
  - Notes on empty/error states
  - Test summary and coverage note
  - Any backend seed command used
