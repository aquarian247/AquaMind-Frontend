# Add Actions & Plan Workflow - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 21, 2024  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Critical Path Unblocked  
**Effort**: ~3 hours  

---

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully implemented the **two critical blockers** preventing end-to-end workflow creation:

1. **Add Actions Form** - Multi-row dialog for populating DRAFT workflows
2. **Plan Workflow Button** - Transition from DRAFT → PLANNED status

These features unblock the complete workflow lifecycle: **Create → Add Actions → Plan → Execute → Complete**

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **1. Add Actions Dialog Component**

**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/workflows/components/AddActionsDialog.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Multi-row dynamic form (add/remove rows)
- ✅ Source container selection (filtered by batch + lifecycle stage + active)
- ✅ Destination container selection (filtered by destination lifecycle stage)
- ✅ Transfer count input with validation
- ✅ Auto-calculate biomass from count × average weight
- ✅ Real-time validation:
  - Transfer count ≤ source population
  - All required fields filled
  - Biomass > 0
- ✅ Summary statistics (total actions, total fish, total biomass)
- ✅ Bulk create all actions via API
- ✅ Error handling with detailed messages
- ✅ Loading states during creation

**Key Validations**:
```typescript
- Source container required
- Dest container required  
- Transfer count must be > 0
- Transfer count ≤ source population (validated per row)
- Biomass must be > 0
```

**Auto-Calculation Logic**:
```typescript
biomass_kg = transferred_count × (average_weight_g / 1000)
```

---

### **2. Plan Workflow Button**

**Location**: Integrated into `WorkflowDetailPage.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows when workflow is DRAFT and has actions
- ✅ One-click transition to PLANNED status
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Loading state during API call
- ✅ Auto-refresh workflow data after planning

**Visibility Logic**:
```typescript
canPlanWorkflow = status === 'DRAFT' && total_actions_planned > 0
```

---

### **3. Enhanced Workflow Detail Page**

**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/workflows/pages/WorkflowDetailPage.tsx`

**New UI Elements**:

1. **Header Actions** (top-right):
   ```
   [Plan Workflow] [Cancel Workflow]
   ```

2. **Actions Card Header**:
   ```
   Transfer Actions                    [Add Actions]
   ```

3. **Empty State** (when no actions):
   ```
   No actions planned for this workflow
   
   [Add Actions to Continue]
   ```

**Conditional Rendering**:
- "Add Actions" button: Shows only when `status === 'DRAFT'`
- "Plan Workflow" button: Shows only when `status === 'DRAFT' && total_actions_planned > 0`

---

### **4. New API Hook**

**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/workflows/api.ts`

```typescript
export function useCreateAction() {
  // Creates a single transfer action
  // Invalidates queries: transfer-actions, transfer-workflow
}
```

**Note**: Currently creates actions sequentially. Consider adding a bulk endpoint for optimization later.

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Flow (Now Working)

### **Step 1: Create Workflow** ✅
```
User → [Create Workflow] → 3-step wizard → Status: DRAFT
```

### **Step 2: Add Actions** ✅ **NEW**
```
User → [Add Actions] → Multi-row form → Bulk create actions
Result: total_actions_planned = N
```

### **Step 3: Plan Workflow** ✅ **NEW**
```
User → [Plan Workflow] → API call → Status: PLANNED
Result: Workflow ready for execution
```

### **Step 4: Execute Actions** ✅ (Already Implemented)
```
Ship Crew → [Execute] on each action → Fill execution form
Result: Actions complete, progress updates
```

### **Step 5: Auto-Complete** ✅ (Already Implemented)
```
Last action executed → Backend auto-completes workflow
Result: Status: COMPLETED, Finance transaction created (if intercompany)
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### **Test Scenario 1: Create Fresh Workflow**

**Steps**:
1. Go to batch detail page
2. Click "Transfers" tab
3. Click "Create Workflow"
4. Fill wizard:
   - Type: Lifecycle Transition
   - Source: Post-Smolt
   - Dest: Adult
   - Planned start: Today
5. Submit → **Workflow created in DRAFT**

**Expected Result**:
- Redirects to workflow detail page
- Status badge shows "DRAFT"
- No actions table shows empty state
- "Add Actions" button visible

---

### **Test Scenario 2: Add Actions**

**Pre-condition**: DRAFT workflow from Scenario 1

**Steps**:
1. On workflow detail page, click "Add Actions"
2. Dialog opens with 1 empty row
3. Fill Row 1:
   - Source: Select any Post-Smolt tank (e.g., "PS-Tank-01 (5,000 fish)")
   - Dest: Select any Adult sea cage (e.g., "Ring-A15 (Cage)")
   - Count: 4,500 (must be ≤ source population)
   - Biomass: Auto-filled (e.g., 225 kg)
4. Click "Add Row" → Row 2 appears
5. Fill Row 2 similarly
6. Click "Add 2 Action(s)"

**Expected Result**:
- Dialog closes
- Actions table now shows 2 rows
- Each row shows: #, PENDING status, source, dest, count, biomass
- Summary shows: "0/2 actions (0%)"
- "Plan Workflow" button now appears in header

**Validation Tests**:
- Try count > source population → Error: "Cannot exceed source population"
- Try leaving source empty → Error: "Source container required"
- Try removing last row → Toast: "At least one action is required"

---

### **Test Scenario 3: Plan Workflow**

**Pre-condition**: DRAFT workflow with actions from Scenario 2

**Steps**:
1. On workflow detail page header, click "Plan Workflow"
2. Wait for API call

**Expected Result**:
- Toast notification: "Workflow Planned - Workflow is now ready for execution"
- Status badge changes to "PLANNED"
- "Plan Workflow" button disappears
- "Add Actions" button disappears (can't edit planned workflows)
- Actions remain PENDING and ready for execution

---

### **Test Scenario 4: Execute Workflow**

**Pre-condition**: PLANNED workflow from Scenario 3

**Steps**:
1. Click "Execute" on Action #1
2. Fill execution dialog:
   - Mortality: 5
   - Method: NET
   - Temp: 12.5
   - O2: 9.2
   - Notes: "Smooth transfer"
3. Submit

**Expected Result**:
- Action #1 status → COMPLETED
- Progress: "1/2 actions (50%)"
- Execute button on Action #2 still available

4. Execute Action #2 similarly

**Final Expected Result**:
- All actions COMPLETED
- Progress: "2/2 actions (100%)"
- Workflow auto-completes to COMPLETED
- If Post-Smolt → Adult: Finance transaction created

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### **1. Sequential Action Creation**
**Current**: Actions created one-by-one via API  
**Impact**: Slow for large workflows (10+ actions)  
**Recommendation**: Backend bulk endpoint (`POST /workflows/{id}/actions/bulk/`)

### **2. Destination Assignment Logic**
**Current**: UI selects destination container ID directly  
**Correct**: For lifecycle transitions, destination assignments should be created during execution  
**Status**: Backend handles this correctly (dest_assignment can be null in DRAFT)  
**Action Required**: Update AddActionsDialog to make dest_assignment optional for lifecycle transitions

### **3. Container Filtering**
**Current**: Destination containers fetched via general container list  
**Issue**: May show containers incompatible with destination lifecycle stage  
**Recommendation**: Add lifecycle stage compatibility filter to container API

### **4. Average Weight Source**
**Current**: Uses `average_weight_g` from source assignment  
**Issue**: Field may not always be populated  
**Fallback**: If null, user must manually enter biomass

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

### **Priority 1: Bulk Actions Endpoint**
```python
# Backend: apps/batch/api/workflow_viewset.py
@action(detail=True, methods=['POST'])
def bulk_add_actions(self, request, pk=None):
    """Add multiple actions in single transaction."""
    workflow = self.get_object()
    actions_data = request.data.get('actions', [])
    
    with transaction.atomic():
        for idx, action_data in enumerate(actions_data):
            action_data['action_number'] = idx + 1
            action_data['workflow'] = workflow.id
            serializer = TransferActionSerializer(data=action_data)
            serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
            serializer.save()
    
    return Response({'created': len(actions_data)})
```

**Frontend**:
```typescript
const result = await ApiService.apiV1BatchTransferWorkflowsBulkAddActionsCreate(
  workflowId,
  { actions: rows.map(row => ...) }
);
```

### **Priority 2: Smart Container Suggestions**
- Auto-populate rows based on current batch assignments
- Suggest destination containers based on capacity
- Warn if destination already has fish

### **Priority 3: Biomass Validation**
- Validate total biomass ≤ destination container capacity
- Show capacity utilization percentage
- Warn if overloading containers

### **Priority 4: Action Templates**
- Save common transfer patterns as templates
- Quick-fill actions from template
- Example: "Standard Post-Smolt to Sea Transfer (10 tanks → 10 cages)"

## 📝 Code Quality Notes

### **TypeScript Strict Mode**: ✅ Passing
All types properly defined, no `any` leaks except for API response typing (generated types)

### **React Best Practices**: ✅ Followed
- Functional components with hooks
- Proper state management
- Effect cleanup
- Error boundaries via toast

### **Accessibility**: ⚠️ Partial
- Semantic HTML used
- Labels for all inputs
- **Missing**: Keyboard navigation for table rows, screen reader announcements for dynamic validation

### **Performance**: ✅ Good
- React Query caching prevents redundant fetches
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- No unnecessary re-renders

---

## 🎓 Implementation Lessons

### **What Went Well**:
1. ✅ Generated API types saved hours of manual typing
2. ✅ Existing patterns (ExecuteActionDialog) easy to follow
3. ✅ React Query invalidation handles refresh automatically
4. ✅ Multi-row form pattern reusable for other features

### **Challenges**:
1. ⚠️ Container assignment API doesn't support all needed filters (worked around)
2. ⚠️ Destination assignment creation logic slightly ambiguous (documented)
3. ⚠️ No bulk endpoint (created TODO for backend team)

### **Recommendations**:
1. Add bulk actions endpoint to backend (2-3 hour task)
2. Enhance container API filtering by lifecycle stage compatibility
3. Add E2E tests for complete workflow (Playwright)
