## 🏆 What We Accomplished

### Backend Implementation (COMPLETE) ✅

**Phase 1: Database Schema**

- ✅ Extended `IntercompanyPolicy` with lifecycle-based pricing
- ✅ Approval tracking fields (approved_by, approval_date)
- ✅ State reordering (PENDING → POSTED → EXPORTED)
- ✅ Migration applied successfully

**Phase 2: Service Layer**
- ✅ `DimensionMappingService` - Container → Company mapping
- ✅ `TransferFinanceService` - Auto-creates transactions with real pricing
- ✅ Workflow integration - Triggers on completion
- ✅ API endpoints - Approve & pending approvals
- ✅ Multi-currency support (DKK, GBP, NOK, ISK, EUR)

## 💰 Finance Transaction Results

**Working Example**:
```
Transaction #20:
  Source: Transfer TRF-2025-001 (Post-Smolt → Adult)
  Amount: €109,270,884.60
  State: PENDING (awaiting approval)
  Posting Date: 2025-03-19
  Biomass: ~766 tonnes @ ~€142/kg
  Companies: FRESHWATER → FARMING
```

**Status**: All 44 transactions in PENDING state, ready for manager approval

**Note**: Large amounts due to test data scale + placeholder pricing. Adjust prices in Django Admin → Finance → Intercompany Policies.

## 🎯 Critical Fixes Made During Session

### Issue 1: Wouter Navigation
- **Problem**: Used `useNavigate` (React Router API)
- **Fix**: Changed to `useLocation()` (Wouter API)
- **Impact**: Pages now load correctly

### Issue 2: Empty Select Values
- **Problem**: Radix UI doesn't allow `value=""` in SelectItem
- **Fix**: Changed to `value="ALL"` with conditional filtering
- **Impact**: Filters work without errors

### Issue 3: Initiated By Required
- **Problem**: Serializer required `initiated_by` in payload
- **Fix**: Added to `read_only_fields` (auto-set by viewset)
- **Impact**: Workflow creation works

### Issue 4: Field Name Mismatches
- **Problem**: Used `stage_name` instead of `name`
- **Fix**: Corrected in seed command and service
- **Impact**: Policies seed correctly, lookups work

### Issue 5: Pricing Logic
- **Problem**: Used destination stage for pricing
- **Fix**: Use source stage (what's being sold, not what it becomes)
- **Impact**: Policies found correctly, transactions created

### Issue 6: Intercompany Detection Timing
- **Problem**: Detected before actions existed
- **Fix**: Call `detect_intercompany()` AFTER creating actions
- **Impact**: 44 transfers correctly identified as intercompany
