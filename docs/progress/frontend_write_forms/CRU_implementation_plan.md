# Frontend CRU Implementation Plan

## Context & Objectives
- Extend the existing read-focused AquaMind frontend to support create, update, and delete workflows across all Django apps noted in the PRD.
- Maintain contract-first alignment with the generated API client and reuse established design patterns (TanStack Query, Tailwind/Shadcn UI, Suspense/Error boundaries).
- Ensure every mutation flow ships with appropriate validation, optimistic UI or refetch strategy, error handling, toast/inline feedback, and comprehensive automated tests.
- Keep tasks sized so a single 250K-context agent session can deliver them end-to-end, including implementation, tests, and documentation updates.
- Enforce the standard session wrap-up: `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run test` (or targeted `npm run test -- <pattern>` when scope is narrow) before hand-off.
- Uphold the shared design system and theme support (Shadcn UI primitives, Tailwind tokens, theme-aware components) for every new form or mutation experience.
- Execute the entire initiative on a single long-lived feature branch (e.g., `feature/frontend-cru-forms`), incorporating each session's work via commits, with one PR raised and merged at completion.
- **🔒 MANDATORY AUDIT TRAIL VERIFICATION**: Before implementing forms for ANY domain, verify backend audit trail compliance using `AUDIT_TRAIL_VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md`. All models MUST have `HistoricalRecords` and all viewsets MUST have `HistoryReasonMixin` (first in MRO) for regulatory compliance. See Phase 4 health app fixes as reference.

## Phase 0 – Foundations & Cross-Cutting Enablement ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-06)

**Status**: All foundation tasks delivered. Established mutation infrastructure, validation library (14 schemas, 86 tests), permission system (RBAC with 7 roles, 41 tests), audit trail capture (dialog + hooks, 19 tests), and verified 100% API coverage (30 entities, zero blockers). Created comprehensive documentation and reusable session checklist. Ready for Phase 1 implementation.

### Task F0.1 – Mutation Architecture, Design System Alignment & UX Pattern ✅
- **Scope**: Audit generated services for mutation endpoints; define shared helpers (`useCrudMutation`, form error translator, toast primitives). Document the canonical form composition pattern leveraging existing design system primitives (Shadcn UI form components, Tailwind utility classes, theme tokens) so all agents follow consistent styling. Include guidance on field spacing, responsive layout, and dark/light theme checks.
- **Deliverables**: Shared mutation hook(s), reusable form layout components, design-system-aligned form template, documented pattern in `docs/frontend_forms.md` (new) or existing README section, example wired to a non-critical entity (e.g., feature flag) as reference.
- **Tests**: Unit tests for helpers (retry logic, error mapping), component test for reference form.
- **Dependencies**: None; must precede all domain tasks.

### Task F0.2 – Validation Schema Library & Type Safety ✅
- **Scope**: Generate or hand-author Zod/Yup schemas derived from OpenAPI types (manual mapping acceptable if automated tool unavailable). Centralize field-level validations (required, numeric ranges, enum mapping) in `client/src/lib/validation`.
- **Deliverables**: Schema modules per domain, type-safe adapter to generated models, documentation snippet.
- **Tests**: Unit tests for schema edge cases and coercion.
- **Dependencies**: After F0.1 to reuse shared utilities.

### Task F0.3 – Notification, Permission, and Audit Hooks ✅
- **Scope**: Extend or create hooks for permission-aware control rendering (based on AuthContext). Ensure create/update/delete actions emit audit trail metadata where supported (e.g., change reasons). Provide consistent success/error toasts and optional inline banners.
- **Deliverables**: `usePermissionGuard`, `useAuditReasonPrompt` (if required), docs update.
- **Tests**: Unit tests for permission guard logic, snapshot tests for toast rendering.
- **Dependencies**: After F0.1.

### Task F0.4 – API Gap Verification & Backend Coordination Checklist ✅

## Session Checklist (applies to every task above)
- Sync OpenAPI spec if backend changes suspected: `npm run sync:openapi`.
- Review relevant OpenAPI endpoints and generated client typings before implementation; raise gaps using the Phase 0 checklist if discrepancies appear.
- **🔒 AUDIT TRAIL CHECKPOINT**: Before implementing ANY domain forms, verify backend audit trail compliance using `AUDIT_TRAIL_VERIFICATION_PLAYBOOK.md`. Ensure all models have `HistoricalRecords` and all viewsets have `HistoryReasonMixin` (first in MRO chain). This is **MANDATORY** for regulatory compliance.
- Implement scoped feature using foundation utilities, domain conventions, and approved design-system components (respect theme tokens, spacing, and accessibility patterns).
- Add/extend Vitest + RTL coverage for new logic; include contract tests for schemas.
- Update relevant docs (feature-level README, changelog section).
- Commit work to the shared feature branch, keeping history tidy (squash locally if preferred). Only open a single PR from that branch once all phases are complete.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run test` (plus targeted suites if long-running).
- Capture manual QA notes (inputs tried, themes checked, environments) in PR description.

## Risk & Coordination Notes
- Align closely with backend to ensure mutation endpoints expose required fields (especially for complex health/broodstock models).
- Monitor form bundle size; apply code splitting where forms are heavy (e.g., scenario wizard) while still using design-system primitives.
- Prioritize incremental rollout by enabling feature flags or hidden routes until QA complete.
- Maintain audit compliance by ensuring change reasons and user attribution included in mutation payloads where backend expects them; confirm styles align across themes before sign-off.
