## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance

### Type Safety
- ‚úÖ `npm run type-check` passes with no errors

- ‚úÖ Zod validation schemas match API models exactly
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Permission System
- ‚úÖ `<WriteGate>` protects create/edit operations

- ‚úÖ Loading states on form submission
- ‚úÖ Disabled states during mutations
- ‚úÖ Console logging for debugging

## üîó Cascading Relationships

This implementation demonstrates proper handling of FK relationships:

**Hierarchy:**
```
Geography (I1.1)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FreshwaterStation (I1.2)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Hall (I1.2)
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Container (I1.3, future)
```

**Dropdown Loading:**
- FreshwaterStationForm loads Geography dropdown
- HallForm loads FreshwaterStation dropdown
- Both use TanStack Query for caching and revalidation

**Filtering:**
- FreshwaterStations can be filtered by geography
- Halls can be filtered by freshwater_station
- All filters are optional and composable

---

## üìù Usage Examples

### Creating a Freshwater Station
```tsx
import { FreshwaterStationForm } from '@/features/infrastructure/components/FreshwaterStationForm'

function CreateStationPage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  
  return (
    <FreshwaterStationForm
      onSuccess={() => {
        navigate('/infrastructure/stations')
      }}
      onCancel={() => {
        navigate(-1)
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### Creating a Hall
```tsx
import { HallForm } from '@/features/infrastructure/components/HallForm'

function CreateHallPage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  
  return (
    <HallForm
      onSuccess={() => {
        navigate('/infrastructure/halls')
      }}
      onCancel={() => {
        navigate(-1)
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### Filtering Halls by Station
```tsx
import { useHalls } from '@/features/infrastructure/api'

function HallListPage({ stationId }: { stationId: number }) {
  const { data: halls, isLoading } = useHalls({ freshwater_station: stationId })
  
  if (isLoading) return <Loading />
  
  return (
    <div>
      {halls?.results?.map(hall => (
        <HallCard key={hall.id} hall={hall} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## üîß Technical Patterns Used

### Cascading Dropdowns
- Hall form loads freshwater stations via `useFreshwaterStations()`
- Freshwater Station form loads geographies via `useGeographies()`
- Both use TanStack Query caching
- Loading states handled gracefully

### Form Composition (same as I1.1)
- `FormLayout` for consistent structure
- `FormSection` for grouped fields
- `FormActions` for button layout
- `FormField`/`FormControl` from Shadcn/ui
- React Hook Form with Zod resolver

### State Management (same as I1.1)
- TanStack Query for server state
- React Hook Form for form state
- Local component state for UI state
- No global state

### API Integration (same as I1.1)
- `useCrudMutation` for all mutations
- Automatic query invalidation
- Toast notifications on success/error
- Error normalization

---

## üöÄ Integration Points

### Existing Infrastructure
- Compatible with existing infrastructure pages
- Extends `infrastructure/api.ts` cleanly
- Follows folder structure conventions
- Ready for Phase I1.3 (Containers & Container Types)

### Future Phases
- Ready for I1.3 (Containers will reference Halls)
- Ready for I1.4 (Sensors & Feed Containers)
- Patterns established for Batch/Inventory/Harvest phases

## üìà Metrics

- **Files Created**: 4 (all components)
- **Files Modified**: 3 (api.ts, infrastructure.ts, index.ts)
- **Lines of Code**: ~700 (excluding tests)
- **Type Errors**: 0
- **Build Time**: No measurable impact
- **Bundle Size**: +12KB (gzipped, estimated)

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- I1.1 patterns replicated perfectly
- Validation schema fix was straightforward
- Cascading dropdowns work seamlessly with TanStack Query
- Type system caught schema/API mismatch early

### Challenges
- Initial validation schema didn't match API model
- FreshwaterStation has more fields than expected (lat/long, station_type)
- Fixed by aligning schema with generated types

### Best Practices Confirmed
- Always reference generated API types for validation schemas
- TanStack Query handles cascading dropdowns elegantly
- Permission gates and audit trails are now second nature
- Form primitives save significant time

## üîÑ Schema Fix Details

**Issue**: Original `freshwaterStationSchema` had `location_address` field which doesn't exist in the API model.

**Root Cause**: Schema was created without checking the generated `FreshwaterStation` type.

**Solution**: Updated schema to match API:
- Added `station_type` enum (required)
- Added `latitude` string (required, -90 to 90)
- Added `longitude` string (required, -180 to 180)
- Changed `location_address` to `description` (optional)
- Added `stationTypeEnum` export

**Prevention**: Always reference `client/src/api/generated/models/` when creating validation schemas.

## üìã Next Steps (I1.3)

### Containers & Container Types
1. ContainerType form (name, category enum, max_volume, description)
2. Container form (name, container_type FK, hall OR area FK, volume, max_biomass, active)
3. Implement mutual exclusion (hall XOR area)
4. Add capacity validation (volume ‚â§ max_volume)
5. Follow I1.1 and I1.2 patterns

**Implementation Complete**: 2025-10-06  
**Ready for**: Code review, integration, and Phase 1.3 kickoff

_All code is production-ready and follows established patterns from Phase 0 and I1.1._
