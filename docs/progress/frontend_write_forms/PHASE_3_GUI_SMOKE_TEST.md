## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

**None identified** - All features working as designed!

## 📞 If Something Breaks

### Issue: Form won't submit
**Check**:
- Console for validation errors
- Network tab for API failures
- Form state (check required fields)

### Issue: Dropdown empty
**Check**:
- Backend has data for that entity
- API endpoint returns results
- Filter conditions not too restrictive

### Issue: Auto-refresh not working
**Check**:
- Query keys match between hooks
- Mutation invalidation includes correct keys
- React Query DevTools (if installed)

### Issue: FIFO warning not appearing
**Check**:
- Container has existing stock entries
- Entry date is earlier than existing entries
- Query for existing stock is enabled

## 🎯 Quick Smoke Test (5 Minutes)

**Absolute minimum to verify Phase 3 works**:

1. ✅ Navigate to Inventory Management page
2. ✅ Create one Feed Type
3. ✅ Create one Feed Purchase (verify total cost calculation)
4. ✅ Add feed to container (verify FIFO display)
5. ✅ Record one Feeding Event (verify cascading filter)
6. ✅ Verify all counts updated

**If all 6 pass**: Phase 3 is ready! 🚀
