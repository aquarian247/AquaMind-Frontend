# B2.1 Batch Creation Redesign - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Branch**: `feature/frontend-cru-forms`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Redesigned batch creation to include inline container assignments with atomic all-or-nothing transaction handling. This improves UX by allowing users to create a batch and immediately assign it to Egg & Alevin trays in a single workflow.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Correction (Phase 1)
- **Fixed lifecycle stage naming**: Changed "Egg" and "Alevin" (separate stages) to "Egg&Alevin" (single stage)
- **Database regenerated**: Wiped and recreated test data with corrected lifecycle stages
- **Verification**: Confirmed Egg&Alevin stage exists as ID 1, order 1

### 2. Frontend Schema & Validation (Phase 3)
**File**: `client/src/lib/validation/batch.ts`

**New schemas added**:
- `batchCreationAssignmentSchema`: Single assignment with hall, container, population, weight
- `batchCreationSchema`: Complete batch + assignments with validation
  - Requires at least 1 assignment
  - Prevents duplicate container selection
  - Validates shared geography + station selection

### 3. API Hooks (Phase 4.3 & 5.3)
**Files**:
- `client/src/features/batch-management/api.ts`
- `client/src/features/infrastructure/api.ts`

**New hooks**:
- `useCreateBatchWithAssignments()`: Atomic batch creation with rollback
  - Creates batch
  - Creates all assignments
  - Rolls back batch if any assignment fails
  - Invalidates queries on success
  - Shows toast notifications

**Enhanced hooks**:
- `useContainers()`: Added filtering by category (TRAY) and exclude_ids
  - Client-side filtering by container_type_name
  - Prevents duplicate selection across assignment rows

### 4. Components (Phase 4.1 & 4.2)
**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/components/BatchCreationAssignmentRow.tsx` (NEW)
- Hall dropdown (filtered by freshwater station)
- Container dropdown (filtered by hall + TRAY category, excludes selected)
- Population count input
- Average weight input (grams, 3 decimal places)
- Auto-calculated biomass badge
- Remove button
- Optional notes textarea

**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/components/BatchCreationForm.tsx` (NEW)
- **Section 1**: Basic batch info (number, species, dates)
- **Section 2**: Shared location (Geography → FreshwaterStation)
- **Section 3**: Dynamic assignment rows
  - Real-time population total
  - Real-time biomass total
  - Add/remove assignment rows
  - Minimum 1 assignment required
- Fixed Egg&Alevin lifecycle stage (auto-selected)
- Create button disabled until at least 1 assignment added

### 5. Integration (Phase 5)
**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/pages/BatchSetupPage.tsx`
- Replaced `BatchForm` with `BatchCreationForm` for batch creation dialog
- Increased dialog width to `max-w-5xl` for larger form
- Updated dialog description

**File**: `client/src/features/batch-management/components/BatchForm.tsx`
- Added deprecation notice for create mode
- Component now only used for EDITING existing batches

## Technical Details

### Cascading Filters (4-level)
```
Geography → FreshwaterStation → Hall → Container(TRAY)
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
  (shared)      (shared)    (per-assignment)  (filtered)
```

### Atomic Transaction Flow
```typescript
1. POST /api/v1/batch/batches/ → { id: batchId }
2. For each assignment:
   POST /api/v1/batch/container-assignments/ → { batch: batchId, ... }
3. If any assignment fails:
   DELETE /api/v1/batch/batches/{batchId}
   throw error
```

### Real-time Calculations
- **Total Population**: `SUM(assignment.population_count)`
- **Total Biomass**: `SUM(assignment.biomass_kg)` where `biomass_kg = (population_count * avg_weight_g) / 1000`

### Container Filtering Logic
```typescript
// API call
containers = await ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureContainersList(
  active: true,
  hall: selectedHallId,
)

// Client-side filtering
filteredContainers = containers.filter(c =>
  (c.container_type_name.includes('tray') || c.container_type_name.includes('egg')) &&
  !selectedContainerIds.includes(c.id)
)
```

## Quality Gates

### Type Check ✅
```bash
npm run type-check
# Result: 0 errors in modified files
```

### Linting ✅
```bash
npm run lint
# Result: 0 errors in modified files
```

### Database Verification ✅
```sql
SELECT id, name, "order" FROM batch_lifecyclestage WHERE name = 'Egg&Alevin';
-- Result: 1 row (ID: 1, order: 1)

SELECT id, name FROM batch_lifecyclestage WHERE name IN ('Egg', 'Alevin');
-- Result: 0 rows (as expected)
```

## User Experience

### Before (Old Flow)
1. Create batch (no assignments)
2. Navigate to Container Assignments
3. Create assignment 1
4. Create assignment 2
5. Create assignment 3...

**Issues**: 
- Batch exists without assignments (incomplete state)
- Multiple page navigations
- No batch-level validation
- Can't see total population until all assignments created

### After (New Flow)
1. Fill batch details
2. Select Geography + Station
3. Add assignment: Hall A → Tray 1, 350k fish, 0.001g
4. Add assignment: Hall A → Tray 2, 350k fish, 0.001g
5. Add assignment: Hall A → Tray 3, 350k fish, 0.001g
6. See real-time totals: **1,050,000 fish, 1.050 kg**
7. Click "Create Batch with Assignments"

**Benefits**:
- Atomic creation (all-or-nothing)
- Single workflow
- Real-time validation (no duplicates)
- Immediate feedback (totals visible)
- Better UX for infrequent operation (~60 batches/year)

## Example Usage

```typescript
// User creates batch with 3 assignments
const batchData = {
  batch_number: "TEST-2025-001",
  species: 1, // Atlantic Salmon
  lifecycle_stage: 1, // Egg&Alevin (auto-set)
  status: "ACTIVE",
  batch_type: "STANDARD",
  start_date: "2025-10-13",
  geography: 1, // Faroe Islands
  freshwater_station: 1, // Station 1
  assignments: [
    {
      tempId: "assign-1",
      hall: 1, // Hall A
      container: 1, // Tray 1
      population_count: 350000,
      avg_weight_g: "0.001",
      biomass_kg: 0.35,
    },
    {
      tempId: "assign-2",
      hall: 1, // Hall A
      container: 2, // Tray 2
      population_count: 350000,
      avg_weight_g: "0.001",
      biomass_kg: 0.35,
    },
    {
      tempId: "assign-3",
      hall: 1, // Hall A
      container: 3, // Tray 3
      population_count: 350000,
      avg_weight_g: "0.001",
      biomass_kg: 0.35,
    },
  ],
}

// Result: Batch created with ID 2
// Result: 3 assignments created (IDs: 1, 2, 3)
// Total: 1,050,000 fish, 1.05 kg biomass
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Container type filtering**: Client-side only (filters by name containing "tray" or "egg")
   - Backend doesn't expose category filter on containers endpoint
   - Acceptable for MVP as filter works correctly for test data
   - Consider backend enhancement for production

2. **Lifecycle stage locked**: Always creates batches at Egg&Alevin stage
   - By design: new batches always start at Egg&Alevin
   - Later stage assignments handled via transfers

3. **Edit mode not updated**: BatchForm still used for editing
   - Editing batches doesn't include assignment management
   - Assignments edited separately via existing forms
   - Could be enhanced in future phase

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 continuation)
- [ ] Task B2.2: Batch transfers
- [ ] Task B2.3: Growth samples & mortality events
- [ ] E2E tests for batch creation flow

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Backend: Add category filter to containers endpoint
- [ ] Frontend: Edit batch with inline assignment management
- [ ] Frontend: Batch duplication workflow
- [ ] Frontend: Import from CSV/Excel

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Egg&Alevin stage exists in database (no separate Egg/Alevin)
- [x] Can create batch with 3 assignments in different containers
- [x] Total fish count calculates correctly (350k × 3 = 1,050,000)
- [x] Total biomass calculates correctly (1.05 kg)
- [x] Cannot select same container twice
- [x] All tests pass (no new failures)
- [x] Zero TypeScript errors in modified files
- [x] Zero linter warnings in modified files

## Lessons Learned

1. **Contract-first approach works**: Generated API types caught issues early
2. **Client-side filtering acceptable**: When backend doesn't support filter, client-side works for small datasets
3. **Atomic mutations require careful error handling**: Rollback logic is critical
4. **Real-time calculations improve UX**: Users appreciate immediate feedback
5. **Deprecation notices prevent confusion**: Clear guidance for other developers
