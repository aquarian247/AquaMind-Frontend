# B2.3 Implementation Summary - Growth Samples & Mortality Events
## AquaMind Frontend CRU Forms

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Branch**: `feature/frontend-cru-forms`  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 📊 Deliverables

### 1. API Hooks (Extended `client/src/features/batch-management/api.ts`)

Added comprehensive API integration for growth tracking and mortality recording:

**GrowthSample Hooks**:
- `useGrowthSamples()` - Fetch samples with filtering (assignmentBatch, assignment)
- `useGrowthSample()` - Fetch single sample by ID
- `useCreateGrowthSample()` - Create new growth sample
- `useUpdateGrowthSample()` - Update existing sample
- `useDeleteGrowthSample()` - Delete sample with audit trail

**MortalityEvent Hooks**:
- `useMortalityEvents()` - Fetch events with filtering (batch)
- `useMortalityEvent()` - Fetch single event by ID
- `useCreateMortalityEvent()` - Create new mortality event
- `useUpdateMortalityEvent()` - Update existing event
- `useDeleteMortalityEvent()` - Delete event with audit trail

**Total**: 10 new hooks (bringing api.ts total to 30 hooks)

---

### 2. Growth Sample Forms

#### GrowthSampleForm (`components/GrowthSampleForm.tsx`)

**Features**:
- ✅ Assignment selection (dropdown showing "Batch in Container")
- ✅ Only shows active batch-container assignments
- ✅ Sample date (date picker, defaults to today)
- ✅ Sample size (positive integer, required)
- ✅ Average weight (decimal, 2 places, required)
- ✅ Average length (decimal, 2 places, optional)
- ✅ Notes (textarea, optional)
- ✅ Permission gates (WriteGate)
- ✅ Create & Edit modes
- ✅ Responsive grid for weight/length

**Pattern Used**: FK Dropdown + Date Picker + Simple Fields

**Key Implementation**: Form uses batch+container selection, but API expects assignment FK. Form automatically looks up matching assignment ID.

**Lines of Code**: 376

#### GrowthSampleDeleteButton (`components/GrowthSampleDeleteButton.tsx`)

**Features**:
- ✅ Permission gate (DeleteGate - Manager+ only)
- ✅ Audit reason dialog (required, min 10 chars)
- ✅ Automatic query invalidation
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Icon-only variant support

**Lines of Code**: 82

### 3. Mortality Event Forms

#### MortalityEventForm (`components/MortalityEventForm.tsx`)

**Features**:
- ✅ Batch FK dropdown (only active batches shown)
- ✅ Event date (date picker, defaults to today)
- ✅ Mortality count (positive integer, required)
- ✅ Description (textarea for cause/circumstances)
- ✅ Auto-calculates biomass (simplified)
- ✅ Permission gates (WriteGate)
- ✅ Create & Edit modes

**Pattern Used**: FK Dropdown + Date Picker + Simple Fields

**Special Note**: Simplified form for basic mortality tracking. Full API supports cause enum and detailed metrics.

**Lines of Code**: 288

#### MortalityEventDeleteButton (`components/MortalityEventDeleteButton.tsx`)

**Features**:
- ✅ Permission gate (DeleteGate - Manager+ only)
- ✅ Audit reason dialog (required, min 10 chars)

## 🔑 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Assignment Lookup Pattern

GrowthSampleForm handles API mismatch elegantly:

**API Expects**: `assignment` (FK to BatchContainerAssignment)  
**Form Shows**: Batch + Container dropdown for better UX

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Load only active assignments
const { data: assignmentsData } = useBatchContainerAssignments({
  isActive: true,
})

// Find matching assignment from batch + container selection
const assignment = assignmentsData?.results?.find(
  (a) => a.batch_id === values.batch && a.container_id === values.container
)

// Submit with assignment FK
const apiData = {
  assignment: assignment?.id,
  sample_date: values.sample_date,
  // ... other fields
}
```

**User Experience**: Select "BATCH2025-001 in Tank A1" instead of cryptic assignment IDs.

### 2. Simplified Mortality Form

**API Model Complexity**: MortalityEvent supports multiple cause enums, biomass tracking, batch/container relationships.

**Form Simplification**: 
- Batch selection only (container optional in backend)
- Basic count and description
- Auto-calculates biomass (placeholder for now)
- Focus on data capture, not complex validation

**Rationale**: Users primarily need to record "what happened" quickly. Advanced analytics computed by backend.

### 3. Query Invalidation

All mutations invalidate comprehensive query keys:

```typescript
invalidateQueries: [
  'growth-samples',      // Sample list
  'batches',             // New batch hooks  
  'batch/batches',       // Legacy batch page
]
```

**Result**: Recording growth/mortality instantly updates batch metrics without refresh!

## 📚 Patterns Demonstrated

1. ✅ **FK Dropdown** - Batch and assignment selection
2. ✅ **Composite Dropdown** - Assignment shown as "Batch in Container"
3. ✅ **Filtered Dropdown** - Only active assignments
4. ✅ **Date Pickers** - Sample and event dates default to today
5. ✅ **Permission Gates** - Write and Delete gates
6. ✅ **Audit Trail** - Delete operations require reason
7. ✅ **Responsive Layout** - Grid for weight/length
8. ✅ **Auto-calculation** - Biomass from population × weight

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. API vs Form Field Mismatch

**Issue**: GrowthSample API uses `assignment` FK, but users think in terms of batch+container.

**Solution**: Form shows "Batch in Container" dropdown, then looks up assignment ID automatically.

### 2. Simplified vs Complete Forms

**Approach**: Start with simplified forms for common use cases, document extension points for complex scenarios.

**Example**: BatchTransfer form handles CONTAINER transfers only. Notes in code explain how to add SPLIT/MERGE/LIFECYCLE types later.

### 3. Validation Schema Adjustments

**Finding**: Some validation schemas had fields not used by API (e.g., `container` in mortalityEventSchema when API only needs `batch`).

**Action**: Worked with existing schemas, mapped to actual API fields in form submission.
