# Frontend Aggregation Adoption Plan (Single-Branch Execution)

> Purpose: Replace client-side aggregations across the app with backend aggregation endpoints and ensure honest fallbacks (N/A) where data is unavailable.

## Branch and Workflow

- Single feature branch: `feature/aggregations-for-frontend` (one PR at the end)
- Contract-first: `npm run sync:openapi` before coding
- Use generated `ApiService` only (no hardcoded URLs)
- Fallbacks must always be honest: display "N/A" or "No data available", never hardcoded totals
- Auth endpoints: `/api/token/` and `/api/token/refresh/` only

## Available Summary Endpoints (high-value)

- Infrastructure
  - `ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureAreasSummaryRetrieve(id)`
  - `ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureFreshwaterStationsSummaryRetrieve(id)`
  - `ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureHallsSummaryRetrieve(id)`
  - `ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureGeographiesSummaryRetrieve(id)`
- Batch
  - `ApiService.apiV1BatchContainerAssignmentsSummaryRetrieve()` with filters: geography, area, station, hall, container_type
- Inventory
  - `/api/v1/inventory/feeding-events/summary/` with `start_date`/`end_date`
  - Batch feeding summaries endpoints
- Scenario
  - `FcrService` and `TrendsService` for FCR trends, stage summaries, and scenario stats
- Environmental, Health, Broodstock
  - No aggregation endpoints identified: audit UIs and enforce N/A fallbacks; avoid client aggregation

## Cross-App Task Plan (session-sized tasks)

Each task below includes scope, endpoints, reading list, QA/acceptance, PO test steps, and dev steps. All tasks commit to the single feature branch with one PR at the end.

### 0) Scaffolding and Guardrails ✅ [COMPLETED 2025-09-18]
- Scope
  - **OpenAPI Sync Check** - Ensure latest backend endpoints are available:
    ```bash
    # Before starting, ensure latest endpoints are available
    npm run sync:openapi
    npm run generate:api
    # Verify summary endpoints exist in generated code
    grep -r "summaryRetrieve" client/src/api/generated/services/
    ```
  - Add feature-level wrappers for generated client:
    - `features/infrastructure/api.ts`: areaSummary, stationSummary, hallSummary, geographySummary
    - `features/inventory/api.ts`: feedingEventsSummaryRange, batchFeedingSummaries
    - `features/batch/api.ts`: containerAssignmentsSummary, fcrTrends
    - `features/scenario/api.ts`: stageSummary, scenarioSummaryStats
  - Add `formatFallback(value, unit?)` utility returning "N/A"/"No data available"
- Reading: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/frontend_testing_guide.md`
- QA: type-check, lint, unit tests for hooks with mocks, fallback behavior covered
- PO test: none (scaffolding only)
- Dev: `npm run sync:openapi && npm run type-check && npm run test`

**Implementation Notes (2025-09-18):**
- ✅ Created comprehensive formatFallback utility with type-specific formatters (formatWeight, formatCurrency, formatPercentage, etc.)
- ✅ API wrappers use the base model types (Area, Hall, etc.) not custom Summary types - the summary endpoints return enriched versions of base models
- ✅ feedingEventsSummary returns inline type with events_count and total_feed_kg fields
- ✅ Test files using JSX must have .tsx extension, not .ts
- ✅ React Query v5 doesn't have isIdle state - use isPending and isFetching instead
- ✅ Generated API signatures may change - always verify parameter order against latest generated code
- ⚠️ Some scenario endpoints lost batch filtering capability in latest API version - may need backend support

### 1) Infrastructure — Area Detail uses Area Summary ✅ [COMPLETED 2025-09-18]
- Scope: `client/src/pages/area-detail.tsx` replace `useAreaKpi` and client joins with `AreasSummaryRetrieve`
- Endpoint: `ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureAreasSummaryRetrieve(id)`
- Reading: Aggregation Playbook; Implementation Plan (Area)
- QA: cards display container_count, ring_count, active_biomass_kg, population_count, avg_weight_kg; missing => N/A
- PO test: login, open Area, confirm metrics or N/A; offline -> safe fallbacks
- Dev: implement + tests (mock `ApiService`)

**Implementation Notes (2025-09-18):**
- ✅ Replaced `useAreaKpi` hook with `useAreaSummary()` from infrastructure API
- ✅ Updated KPI cards to display: container_count, ring_count, active_biomass_kg, population_count, avg_weight_kg
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types (`AreaSummary`) for aggregated data fields
- ✅ Used `formatFallback()` functions for honest display of missing data
- ✅ Updated loading states to include areaSummary loading with "..." indicators
- ✅ Removed client-side biomass/population aggregation logic (now server-side)
- ✅ Maintained container details for ring view while removing client calculations
- ✅ Cleaned up all Replit dependencies and remnants
- ✅ All tests passing, TypeScript clean, no linter errors
- ✅ Dev server running with proper proxy configuration
- ✅ Backend API verified working correctly with authentication
- ✅ Frontend proxy correctly forwarding API requests

**✅ TASK 1 COMPLETE - Server-side aggregation successfully implemented**

### 2) Infrastructure — Station Detail uses Station Summary ✅ [COMPLETED 2025-09-18]
- Scope: `client/src/pages/station-detail.tsx` KPI cards to `FreshwaterStationsSummaryRetrieve`
- Endpoint: `ApiService.apiV1InfrastructureFreshwaterStationsSummaryRetrieve(id)`
- Reading: Implementation Plan (Station)
- QA: halls, containers, biomass, population, avg weight correct or N/A
- PO test: open Station; verify metrics
- Dev: implement + tests

**Implementation Notes (2025-09-18):**
- ✅ Replaced `useStationKpi` hook with `useStationSummary()` from infrastructure API
- ✅ Updated KPI cards to display: hall_count, container_count, active_biomass_kg, population_count, avg_weight_kg
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded values in Efficiency Score and Staff & Certification cards (replaced with "N/A")
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types (`FreshwaterStationSummary`) for aggregated data fields
- ✅ Used `formatFallback()` functions for honest display of missing data
- ✅ Updated loading states with "..." indicators during data fetch
- ✅ Removed client-side calculation logic (now server-side via summary endpoint)
- ✅ All tests passing, TypeScript clean, no linter errors
- ✅ Fixed runtime errors with defensive null/undefined checks
- ✅ **DISCOVERED & FIXED CRITICAL BACKEND BUG**: Container API `hall__in` filtering was broken
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage for multiple hall filtering

**Backend Bug Fix (Container API Filtering):**
- **Issue**: `hall__in=151,152,153,154,155` returned count=71 but only 20 results
- **Root Cause**: DjangoFilterBackend's `filterset_fields` doesn't support `__in` lookups for foreign keys
- **Fix**: Created custom `ContainerFilter` with explicit `hall__in` and `area__in` support
- **Impact**: Fixed data integrity across all container filtering operations
- **Test**: Added `test_filter_by_multiple_halls()` to prevent regression

**✅ TASK 2 COMPLETE - Server-side aggregation successfully implemented + Backend bug fixed**

### 2.5) Frontend Multi-Entity Filtering Integration ✅ [COMPLETED 2025-10-01]
- Scope: Establish frontend foundation for reliable multi-entity filtering to enable robust aggregations discovered during Task 2 backend investigation
  - **OpenAPI Sync**: `npm run sync:openapi` to capture new `__in` filtering parameters across all critical endpoints
  - **Multi-Select Components**: Create/enhance filter components to support comma-separated ID selection
    - `MultiSelectFilter.tsx`: Reusable component for selecting multiple entities (halls, areas, batches, species)
    - `useMultiEntityFilter()`: Custom hook for managing multi-entity filter state
    - `formatInFilter(ids: number[])`: Utility for proper comma-separated formatting
  - **API Integration**: Update existing filter logic to leverage new `__in` capabilities
    - Container filtering: `hall__in`, `area__in` support
    - Batch filtering: `species__in`, `lifecycle_stage__in` support  
    - Assignment filtering: `batch__in`, `container__in` support
    - Environmental filtering: `parameter__in`, `container__in`, `batch__in`, `sensor__in` support
    - Inventory filtering: `batch__in`, `container__in`, `feed__in` support
  - **Enhanced Filter Validation**: Frontend validation for proper `__in` parameter formatting
  - **Performance Optimization**: Implement debouncing and query optimization for large ID arrays
  - **Error Handling**: Robust handling of malformed `__in` parameters with user-friendly error messages

- Endpoints Enhanced: ALL endpoints now support reliable multi-entity filtering:
  - Infrastructure: `/containers/`, `/areas/`, `/halls/`, `/freshwater-stations/`, `/sensors/`, `/feed-containers/`
  - Batch: `/batches/`, `/container-assignments/`, `/mortality-events/`, `/growth-samples/`
  - Inventory: `/feeding-events/`
  - Environmental: `/readings/`, `/photoperiod-data/`, `/weather-data/`

- Reading: Backend API standards documentation, filtering implementation details from Task 2 backend fixes
- QA: Multi-select filters return accurate counts, complete datasets, proper pagination; malformed input shows helpful errors
- PO test: Select multiple entities in filter dropdowns across all major pages; verify accurate results and no missing data
- Dev: `npm run sync:openapi && npm run type-check && npm run test`

**Critical Success Metrics:**
- ✅ All `__in` filters return counts matching direct database queries
- ✅ Pagination works correctly with multi-entity filtering  
- ✅ Frontend validation prevents malformed API requests
- ✅ Multi-select UX is intuitive and performant
- ✅ No false positives or missing data in filtered results

**Why This Task is Essential:**
This task establishes the reliable filtering foundation that all subsequent aggregation tasks depend on. Without it, Tasks 4-7 would be building on unreliable filtering that could cause data integrity issues, incomplete aggregations, and UAT failures.

**Implementation Notes (2025-10-01):**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `filterUtils.ts` with 8 utility functions for formatting, parsing, validation
- ✅ Implemented `useMultiEntityFilter` hook with full state management, debouncing, validation, and warnings
- ✅ Built reusable `MultiSelectFilter` component with searchable dropdown, badges, error/warning display
- ✅ All utilities tested with 40+ tests covering edge cases, validation, and performance scenarios
- ✅ Hook tested with 23+ tests covering state management, validation, debouncing, and callbacks
- ✅ OpenAPI sync confirmed new `__in` parameters across all critical endpoints
- ✅ Created comprehensive README with usage examples and integration patterns
- ✅ Built demo page showcasing complete integration with generated API client
- ✅ Performance optimization: automatic debouncing (300ms default), large array warnings (>100 IDs)
- ✅ Error handling: validation for invalid IDs, helpful error messages, performance warnings
- ✅ Type-safe implementation with full TypeScript support

**Key Learnings & Best Practices:**
1. **Debouncing is Essential**: Default 300ms debounce prevents API spam during rapid filter changes
2. **Performance Warnings**: Automatic warnings when selecting >100 entities helps prevent slow queries
3. **Validation First**: Frontend validation catches malformed IDs before API calls
4. **Dedupe Automatically**: Filtering duplicates in `formatInFilter` prevents API confusion
5. **Badge UX**: Showing selected items as removable badges improves UX significantly
6. **Search Integration**: Searchable dropdown is critical for large entity lists (50+ items)
7. **Summary Display**: `filterSummary` provides at-a-glance understanding of active filters
8. **onChange Callback**: Debounced onChange enables analytics tracking without performance hit
9. **Empty State Handling**: Proper handling of empty arrays, null, undefined prevents edge case bugs
10. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests (63 total) caught several edge cases during development

**Files Created:**
- `client/src/lib/filterUtils.ts` - Core filtering utilities (8 functions, 40 tests)
- `client/src/hooks/useMultiEntityFilter.ts` - State management hook (23 tests)
- `client/src/components/filters/MultiSelectFilter.tsx` - Reusable UI component

- `client/src/components/filters/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation (600+ lines)
- `client/src/pages/examples/multi-entity-filtering-demo.tsx` - Integration demo

**Backend Dependencies Met:**
- ✅ Backend Issue #73 filtering fixes deployed and verified
- ✅ OpenAPI spec updated with all `__in` parameters
- ✅ Generated API client includes new filter parameters
- ✅ All critical endpoints support multi-entity filtering

**✅ TASK 2.5 COMPLETE - Frontend multi-entity filtering foundation ready for Tasks 3-7**

## Critical Backend Filtering Foundation **[COMPLETED 2025-09-18]**

**🚨 Context**: During Task 2 (Station Detail) implementation, a critical `__in` filtering bug was discovered that would have been a UAT showstopper. This bug was comprehensively fixed across ALL ViewSets before proceeding with frontend aggregation work.

**✅ Backend Filtering Fixes Completed**:
- **Issue**: Django REST Framework's `DjangoFilterBackend` with `filterset_fields` did not support `__in` lookups for foreign key relationships
- **Impact**: Incorrect counts, incomplete result sets, broken pagination across multiple critical endpoints  
- **Solution**: Created custom `FilterSet` classes with explicit `['exact', 'in']` support for all foreign key fields
- **Scope**: Fixed 15+ ViewSets across Infrastructure, Batch, Inventory, and Environmental apps
- **Validation**: 802 tests passing, comprehensive API testing, no regressions

**🎯 Why This Enables Enhanced Aggregation Tasks**:
The enhanced scope of Tasks 3.5-7 is only possible because of this filtering foundation:
- **Multi-Geography Analysis** requires reliable `geography__in` filtering
- **Cross-Batch Comparisons** require reliable `batch__in` and `species__in` filtering  
- **Location-Based Aggregations** require reliable `hall__in`, `area__in`, `container__in` filtering
- **Environmental Integration** requires reliable `area__in`, `container__in` filtering
- **Complex FCR Analytics** require reliable multi-entity filtering across all batch-related endpoints

**Frontend Dependencies**: Task 3.5 (Frontend Multi-Entity Filtering Integration) must complete before Tasks 4-7 to ensure proper OpenAPI sync and frontend integration of these backend capabilities.

**UAT Impact**: Without these fixes, UAT would have failed due to missing data, incorrect counts, and broken multi-entity operations. With these fixes, UAT can now test sophisticated multi-entity analysis scenarios with confidence.
