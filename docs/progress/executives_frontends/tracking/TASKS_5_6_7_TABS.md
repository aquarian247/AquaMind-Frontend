## Placeholder Data Strategy

All tabs with missing endpoints use consistent pattern:
1. **Integration Pending Banner** - Clear explanation with endpoint reference
2. **KPI Cards with N/A** - Honest fallbacks using formatFallback
3. **Placeholder Charts** - Info icon + "Coming soon" message
4. **Migration Ready** - When endpoints added, just remove `enabled: false` from hooks

---

## Next Steps

- Create `ExecutiveDashboardPage.tsx` that combines all tabs
- Add tab navigation (Overview, Financial, Strategic, Market)
- Add geography filter in header
- Integrate with app routing
- Add sidebar menu item

**Estimated Context Used:** 15% (on budget)

**Ready for:** Task 8 - Main Dashboard Page & Routing
