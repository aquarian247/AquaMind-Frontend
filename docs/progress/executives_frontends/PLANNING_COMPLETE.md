## Documentation Delivered

### Master Plan
- `MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive overview

---

## Plan Highlights

### Task-Based Approach ✅
- **37 total tasks** across all dashboards
- **Session-sized** (< 50% context window each)
- **Sequential execution** within each dashboard
- **Clear dependencies** documented

### Architecture Aligned ✅
- **Features/ structure** - Each dashboard is a feature slice
- **Generated ApiService** - Contract-first development
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management
- **Honest fallbacks** - formatFallback utilities
- **TypeScript strict** - Full type safety
- **Testing required** - 80%+ coverage per dashboard

### Business Logic Captured ✅
- **KPI calculations** documented
- **Color-coding thresholds** specified
- **Ranking algorithms** described
- **Size distribution formulas** defined
- **Alert level logic** captured

## Quick Decision Matrix

### Which Dashboard to Build First?

| Dashboard | Build First If... | Dependencies |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Executive** | Want fastest win, establish patterns | Finance endpoints (TBD) |
| **Freshwater** | Freshwater team urgent, complex calculations | None (all endpoints ready) |
| **Sea Operations** | Operations team urgent, have prototype | Market prices (TBD) |

**Recommendation:** Executive → Freshwater → Sea Operations

**Reasoning:**
1. Executive establishes KPICard and shared components
2. Freshwater introduces environmental complexity
3. Sea Operations most complex but can reuse most patterns

---

## Execution Approaches

### 🔷 Sequential (Recommended)
Complete one dashboard fully before starting next.

**Pros:** Lower risk, patterns reusable, easier UAT  
**Timeline:** 9-12 sessions over 5-6 days

### 🔶 Hybrid
Complete Executive, then parallelize Freshwater + Sea Ops foundations.

**Pros:** Faster time to market, patterns established first  
**Timeline:** 9 sessions over 4-5 days

### 🔴 Parallel (Advanced)
All three simultaneously (requires coordination).

**Pros:** Fastest calendar time  
**Cons:** Highest coordination overhead  
**Timeline:** 4-5 sessions over 2-3 days

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (You Choose)

**Option A: Start Executive Dashboard**
```bash
cd /Users/aquarian247/Projects/AquaMind-Frontend
cat docs/progress/executives_frontends/executive-dashboard-plan/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

# Begin Task 0: Backend API Gap Analysis
# (Read-only task, safe to start immediately)
```

**Option B: Start Freshwater Dashboard**
```bash
# Begin Task 0: Weekly Report Analysis & Data Mapping
# (Analysis task, no code changes)
```

**Option C: Start Sea Operations Dashboard**
```bash
# Begin Task 0: Prototype Extraction & Analysis
# (Analysis task, already extracted tarball)
```

### Before Starting Implementation
1. ✅ Review chosen plan thoroughly
2. ✅ Understand task breakdown
3. ✅ Check backend API availability
4. ✅ Sync OpenAPI spec: `npm run sync:openapi`
5. ✅ Ensure dev environment running

---

## Backend Coordination

### APIs Ready for Use
- ✅ All infrastructure summaries
- ✅ Batch container assignment summaries
- ✅ Lice counts summary & trends (NEW)
- ✅ Feeding events summary
- ✅ FCR trends
- ✅ Environmental readings
- ✅ Growth samples
- ✅ Mortality events

### APIs May Need Creation
- ⚠️ Market prices (Stágri Salmon Index)
- ⚠️ Financial summary (revenue, EBITDA, costs)
- ⚠️ Harvest forecast aggregation

**Approach:** Proceed with available endpoints + mock placeholders for missing ones. Backend team can implement in parallel.

---

## Key Success Factors

### Do's ✅
- Follow task sequence in plan
- Use generated ApiService exclusively
- Apply formatFallback for missing data
- Test each component as you build
- Keep files under 300 LOC
- Extract shared components when duplication emerges
- Update progress in plan folder

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't skip Task 0 (analysis tasks provide critical context)
- Don't hardcode mock data without disclosure banners
- Don't use client-side aggregation (use backend endpoints)
- Don't create massive monolithic components
- Don't neglect testing (write tests alongside code)
- Don't ignore TypeScript errors

## Estimated Timeline

### Conservative (Sequential)
- **Week 1:** Executive Dashboard (2-3 sessions)
- **Week 2-3:** Freshwater Dashboard (3-4 sessions)
- **Week 3-4:** Sea Operations Dashboard (4-5 sessions)
- **Total:** 3-4 weeks (one agent working sequentially)

### Optimistic (Hybrid)
- **Days 1-2:** Executive Dashboard complete
- **Days 3-5:** Freshwater Dashboard complete (reuses patterns)
- **Days 6-9:** Sea Operations Dashboard complete (reuses patterns)
- **Total:** 9-10 working days

1. ✅ **Navigation:** Add menu items to sidebar (RBAC later)
2. ✅ **Lice Enhancement:** Separate prerequisite - COMPLETE
3. ✅ **Freshwater Specs:** Using screenshots + analysis docs
4. ✅ **Executive Integration:** Rebuild following AquaMind patterns
5. ✅ **Sea Ops Code:** Combination approach (reuse logic, rebuild UI)

## Ready to Rock! 🚀

You now have:
1. ✅ Complete backend foundation (lice enhancement)
2. ✅ Three detailed implementation plans
3. ✅ Task breakdown for manageable execution
4. ✅ All source materials organized
5. ✅ Clear execution paths
6. ✅ Quality gates defined

**Pick a dashboard and dive into Task 0!**

The plans are designed to guide you (or an AI agent) through systematic implementation with minimal ambiguity and maximum chance of success.

---

## Final Notes

- **RBAC will be dynamic later** - For now, just add menu items
- **Mock data is acceptable** - IF clearly disclosed with banners
- **Backend gaps are documented** - Can proceed without waiting
- **Prototype code preserved** - Available for reference
- **All personas considered** - From CEO to station operators

**Total Impact:** Replace 70+ pages of manual reporting with real-time analytics across 3 critical operational roles.
