**Best For:** Third implementation (most complex, has prototype)

---

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Answered Questions
1. **Layout:** Add new sidebar menu items (RBAC can be dynamic later)
2. **Lice Enhancement:** Separate backend plan ✅ COMPLETE
3. **Freshwater UI:** Based on screenshots + analysis docs
4. **Executive Approach:** Rebuild from prototype using AquaMind patterns
5. **Sea Ops Approach:** Combination (reuse logic, rebuild UI)
6. **API Status:** Cross-referenced implementation plans

### 📋 Backend Prerequisites
- ✅ **Complete:** Lice enhancement (summary/trends endpoints)
- ✅ **Complete:** Infrastructure/batch/inventory aggregations
- ⚠️ **TBD:** Market prices (external integration)
- ⚠️ **TBD:** Financial aggregations

**Approach:** Proceed with available endpoints, use mock data with disclosure for missing ones.

## 💡 Recommended Execution Path

### For Single Agent/Developer
```
Step 1: Executive Dashboard (2-3 sessions)
   ↓ Establishes KPICard, StatusBadge, theme patterns
   
Step 2: Freshwater Dashboard (3-4 sessions)
   ↓ Adds environmental complexity, time-series charts
   
Step 3: Sea Operations Dashboard (4-5 sessions)
   ↓ Most comprehensive, reuses all patterns
```

**Total:** 9-12 sessions over 5-6 days

### For Team/Parallel Execution
```
Agent 1: Executive Dashboard Tasks 0-10 (complete)
         ↓
Agent 2: Freshwater Dashboard Tasks 0-13 (parallel with Agent 3)
         ↓
Agent 3: Sea Operations Dashboard Tasks 0-14 (parallel with Agent 2)
```

**Total:** 4-5 sessions over 2-3 days (requires coordination)

## 🛠️ Technical Approach Summary

### What We're Reusing
- ✅ Prototype business logic (KPI formulas, thresholds)
- ✅ Existing AquaMind components (Shadcn/ui, charts)
- ✅ Backend aggregation endpoints
- ✅ Generated ApiService (contract-first)
- ✅ formatFallback utilities

### What We're Building New
- ❌ TypeScript components (rebuild from JSX prototypes)
- ❌ TanStack Query hooks (replace static data)
- ❌ Feature-sliced architecture (features/ folders)
- ❌ Multi-theme support (not just Solarized)
- ❌ RBAC integration (useAuth hooks)

- Backend dependencies
- Success metrics

### Step 2: Read Full Plan
`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` contains:
- Detailed task breakdown
- Code examples
- Success criteria per task
- Context estimates

### Step 3: Execute Tasks
