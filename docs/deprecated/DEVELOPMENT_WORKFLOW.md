# DEPRECATED: Development Workflow (Old Django + React)

This guide has been superseded by:

* `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` – updated developer setup & workflow (OpenAPI-first, generated client)
* `docs/DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` – current CI/CD & network diagram

It is retained here for historical reference only. Do **not** follow these steps for new feature work.
