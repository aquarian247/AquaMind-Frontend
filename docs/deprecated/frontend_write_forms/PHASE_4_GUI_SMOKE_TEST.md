## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### 1. File Upload Not Implemented (HealthLabSample)
**Issue**: Cannot attach lab report files  
**Workaround**: Use Django admin for file uploads  
**Impact**: Low (can still record all data)  
**Future**: Will be implemented when file upload utilities available

### 2. Parameter Scores Not in UI (IndividualFishObservation)
**Issue**: Schema supports parameter_scores but UI doesn't display/edit them  
**Workaround**: Backend supports it, can add later if needed  
**Impact**: Low (weight/length measurements are primary need)  
**Future**: Can add parameter scoring interface as enhancement

### 3. Edit Mode for Nested Data
**Issue**: Editing sampling events with nested fish observations not fully tested  
**Workaround**: Create new event if edit issues found  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Future**: Test thoroughly in UAT, fix if needed

---

## 📞 If Something Breaks

### Issue: Conditional field not appearing
**Check**:
- Watched field has correct value
- Field name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Console for React Hook Form errors

### Issue: K-Factor shows NaN or Infinity
**Check**:
- Weight and length both entered
- Length is not zero
- Values are positive numbers
- parseFloat conversion working

### Issue: Aggregates not calculating
**Check**:
- At least one fish has both weight AND length
- useMemo dependencies correct
- Console for calculation errors
- Form.watch() returning data

### Issue: Dynamic rows not adding
**Check**:
- useFieldArray configured correctly
- append() function being called
- fields.length updating
- No validation blocking append

### Issue: Vaccination type not showing
**Check**:
- Treatment type is exactly "vaccination" (lowercase)
- Conditional expression matches enum value
- Watch hook returning correct value
- VaccinationTypes query loading data

---

## 🎯 Quick Smoke Test (10 Minutes)

**Absolute minimum to verify Phase 4 works**:

1. ✅ Navigate to Health Management page
2. ✅ Create one Journal Entry (test conditional resolution notes)
3. ✅ Create one Sampling Event with 3 fish (verify K-factor, aggregates)
4. ✅ Create one Lab Sample (verify multi-date tracking)
5. ✅ Create one Medication Treatment (verify vaccination_type hidden)
6. ✅ Create one Vaccination Treatment (verify vaccination_type appears!)
7. ✅ Create one Sample Type (verify appears in dropdown)
8. ✅ Delete any entity (verify audit trail prompt)
9. ✅ Verify all 6 card counts updated

**If all 9 pass**: Phase 4 is ready! 🚀
