# Phase 4: UAT Issues Found During Testing

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Tester**: User  
**Context**: Manual testing of Phases 1-4 forms  
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Fixes being applied

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Forms Tested**: Infrastructure, Batch, Inventory, Health  
**Overall Status**: ✅ **Create operations work!**  
**Issues Found**: 5 (2 critical bugs, 3 enhancements)

## 🐛 Critical Bugs (Fix Immediately)

### Bug 1: LifecycleStage Creation Returns 400 Error

**Severity**: 🚨 HIGH  
**Phase**: Batch (Phase 2)  
**Component**: `LifecycleStageForm.tsx`

**Symptom**:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/batch/lifecycle-stages/ 400 (Bad Request)
Error: Bad request (validation error)
```

**Likely Causes**:
1. Duplicate species + order combination (unique_together constraint)
2. Invalid decimal format for optional weight/length fields
3. Missing required field

**Debug Added**: Console logging to show payload being sent

**Next Steps**:
- Check console log for submitted values
- Verify species + order combination is unique
- Check decimal field format (backend expects strings like "10.50")

**Priority**: P0 - Must fix before UAT

### Bug 2: GrowthSample Duplicate Key Warning

**Severity**: ⚠️ MEDIUM  
**Phase**: Batch (Phase 2)  
**Component**: `GrowthSampleForm.tsx`

**Symptom**:
```
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `undefined-undefined`.
```

**Root Cause**: SelectItem uses `${batch_id}-${container_id}` as value, but if either is undefined, creates duplicate keys

**Fix Applied**: ✅ FIXED
```typescript
// Added filter to remove assignments with missing IDs
{assignmentsData?.results
  ?.filter((a) => a.batch_id && a.container_id)
  .map((assignment) => (
    <SelectItem key={assignment.id} value={`${assignment.batch_id}-${assignment.container_id}`}>
      {assignment.batch?.batch_number || `Batch ${assignment.batch_id}`} in{' '}
      {assignment.container?.name || `Container ${assignment.container_id}`}
    </SelectItem>
  ))}
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed, ready for retest

**Priority**: P1 - Fixed

## 🎨 UX Enhancements (Defer or Plan)

### Enhancement 1: BatchContainerAssignment Cascading Filters Regression

**Severity**: ⚠️ MEDIUM  
**Phase**: Batch (Phase 2)  
**Component**: `BatchContainerAssignmentForm.tsx`

**Issue**: Current form only shows container dropdown with first 20 active containers (pagination limitation)

**Desired UX**:
1. Select Geography → limits FreshwaterStation dropdown
2. Select FreshwaterStation → limits Hall dropdown
3. Select Hall → limits Container dropdown to **empty/unassigned** containers in that hall
4. Multi-level drill-down like Sensor/FeedContainer forms (Phase 1)

**Current Workaround**: Container dropdown works but shows all containers (pagination limited to 20)

**Notes**:
- History and user assignment work correctly ✅
- Create functionality works ✅
- Just UX optimization needed

**Recommendation**: Create separate task/issue for cascading filter enhancement

**Priority**: P2 - Enhancement (not blocking UAT if assignment creation works)

---

### Enhancement 2: Map Integration for Area Creation

**Severity**: 💡 LOW  
**Phase**: Infrastructure (Phase 1)  
**Component**: `AreaForm.tsx`

**Desired Feature**:
- Visual map component
- Click map → populate lat/long coordinates
- Enter coordinates → show marker on map
- Bi-directional sync

**Current State**: Text input fields for latitude/longitude (works, just not visual)

**Recommendation**: Defer to post-UAT enhancement (requires map library integration)

**Priority**: P3 - Enhancement (nice-to-have)

---

### Enhancement 3: Map Integration for FreshwaterStation Creation

**Severity**: 💡 LOW  
**Phase**: Infrastructure (Phase 1)  
**Component**: `FreshwaterStationForm.tsx`

**Desired Feature**: Same as Enhancement 2 (map integration)

**Current State**: Text input fields work

**Recommendation**: Defer to post-UAT enhancement

**Priority**: P3 - Enhancement (nice-to-have)

---

### Enhancement 4: Delete Buttons for Infrastructure Entities

**Severity**: ⚠️ MEDIUM  
**Phase**: Infrastructure (Phase 1)  
**Status**: User noted "need to think about implementation"

**Issue**: No delete buttons visible for Infrastructure entities (Geography, Area, Container, etc.)

**Possible Reasons**:
1. Delete buttons exist but permission gate hiding them?
2. Delete buttons not integrated into infrastructure pages?
3. Intentionally deferred during Phase 1?

**Recommendation**: User to decide on implementation approach

**Priority**: P2 - Deferred per user decision

## ✅ What's Working Well

### Infrastructure Forms (Phase 1)
- ✅ Geography create works
- ✅ Area create works
- ✅ FreshwaterStation create works
- ✅ Hall create works
- ✅ Container create works
- ✅ Sensor create works

### Batch Forms (Phase 2)
- ✅ Batch create works
- ✅ BatchContainerAssignment create works (history ✅, user assignment ✅)
- ⚠️ LifecycleStage create has validation error (investigating)
- ⚠️ GrowthSample has React warning (fixed!)

### Inventory Forms (Phase 3)
- ✅ All create operations work (Feed, FeedPurchase, FeedContainerStock, FeedingEvent)

### Health Forms (Phase 4)
- ✅ All create operations work (7 entities)

---

## 📋 Action Plan

### Immediate (Before Next Test Session)

1. **✅ DONE**: Fix GrowthSample duplicate key warning
2. **🔄 IN PROGRESS**: Debug LifecycleStage 400 error
   - Check console log for payload
   - Verify unique constraint not violated
   - Check decimal field format

### Short Term (Before UAT)

3. **⏳ TODO**: Decide on Infrastructure delete button implementation
4. **⏳ TODO**: Fix or defer BatchContainerAssignment cascading filters

### Long Term (Post-UAT)

5. **💡 DEFER**: Map integration for Area/FreshwaterStation forms
6. **💡 DEFER**: Any other UX enhancements

## 🔍 Debug Instructions for LifecycleStage

**When you try to create again**, check console for:

```javascript
// Should see this log:
Submitting LifecycleStage: {
  species: 2,           // Should be a number
  name: "Your Name",    // Should be a string
  order: 3,             // Should be a number
  description: "...",   // Can be empty string
  expected_weight_min_g: "10.00",  // Should be string or empty
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Look for**:
1. Is `species` a valid number? (not empty string or undefined)
2. Is `order` unique for that species? (check existing lifecycle stages)
3. Are decimal fields in correct format? (strings like "10.50" or empty "")

**Common Causes of 400**:
- Duplicate species + order (unique_together violation)
- Invalid decimal format
- Missing required field
