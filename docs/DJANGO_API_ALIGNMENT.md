# Django API Alignment Summary

## Analysis of Current vs Django Backend

Based on the Django backend documentation and Postman collection, significant changes are needed to align the frontend stubs with the actual backend structure.

### Key Changes Implemented

1. **API Structure**: Updated to use `/api/v1/` prefixed endpoints organized by Django apps:
   - Environmental: `/api/v1/environmental/`
   - Batch: `/api/v1/batch/`
   - Inventory: `/api/v1/inventory/`
   - Health: `/api/v1/health/`
   - Species: `/api/v1/species/`
   - Stages: `/api/v1/stages/`

2. **New Models Added**:
   - Species (fish species information)
   - Stages (life cycle stages)
   - LabSamples (laboratory testing)
   - HealthAssessments (detailed health evaluations)
   - WeatherData (environmental conditions)

3. **Schema Updates**:
   - Updated Batch model to use proper foreign key references to Species and Stages
   - Added proper Django-style field mappings
   - Implemented paginated response format with count, next, previous, results

4. **Response Format**: All endpoints now return Django REST framework style responses:
   ```json
   {
     "count": 10,
     "next": null,
     "previous": null,
     "results": [...]
   }
   ```

### Remaining Work

The TypeScript errors need to be resolved by fixing type mismatches in the storage implementation where optional fields are being treated as required. The main issues are:

1. Optional fields like `description`, `notes`, `sensor` need explicit null handling
2. Missing `feedCost` field in FeedingEvent seeded data
3. Required fields like `status`, `isActive` need default values

### Legacy Compatibility

Legacy dashboard endpoints remain functional to support the current frontend while new Django API endpoints are available for future migration.
