# Health App UI/UX Analysis

## Health Data Model Overview

Based on the data model review, the health app includes these key tables:

1. **health_journalentry** - Core medical journal entries
2. **health_healthparameter** - Health parameters that can be measured
3. **health_healthsamplingevent** - Sampling events when health checks occur
4. **health_individualfishobservation** - Individual fish observations during sampling
5. **health_fishparameterscore** - Scores for specific health parameters (1-5 scale)
6. **health_mortalityreason** - Reasons for mortality (lookup table)
7. **health_mortalityrecord** - Records of mortality events linked to batches/containers
8. **health_licecount** - Sea lice counting data with adult/juvenile breakdowns
9. **health_vaccinationtype** - Types of vaccinations (lookup table)
10. **health_treatment** - Treatment records for batches/containers

## Health App Requirements from PRD

From section 3.1.4 of the PRD:

- **Purpose**: To monitor and document fish batch health, ensuring timely interventions through detailed observations, general health logging, and quantified health/growth metrics.
- **Primary users**: Veterinarians, Quality Assurance personnel
- **Secondary users**: Farm Operators (for data entry), Area Managers, Production Managers
- **Key integration points**: Batch management, Container views

## Persona Analysis for Health Features

### Primary Health App Users

1. **Veterinarian**
   - **Access level**: Full edit access to all health records
   - **Primary needs**: 
     - Complete medical journal view
     - Treatment planning and recording
     - Health trend analysis across batches
     - Vaccination scheduling and tracking
     - Disease outbreak monitoring
   - **Contextual needs**:
     - Batch history integration
     - Environmental parameter correlation
     - Container-specific health views

2. **Quality Assurance Personnel**
   - **Access level**: Full edit access to health parameters, read-only for treatments
   - **Primary needs**:
     - Health sampling event recording
     - Parameter scoring and tracking
     - Compliance monitoring
     - Quality metrics reporting
   - **Contextual needs**:
     - Batch quality tracking over time
     - Cross-batch comparison
     - Regulatory compliance reporting

### Secondary Health App Users

3. **Farm Operator**
   - **Access level**: Limited edit access (mortality recording, lice counting)
   - **Primary needs**:
     - Simple mortality recording interface
     - Lice counting data entry
     - Basic health observation logging
   - **Contextual needs**:
     - Container-specific quick entry
     - Mobile-friendly interfaces for field use

4. **Area Manager**
   - **Access level**: Read-only for all health data
   - **Primary needs**:
     - Health status overview by area
     - Treatment history and effectiveness
     - Mortality trends and patterns
   - **Contextual needs**:
     - Area-wide health analytics
     - Exception reporting and alerts

5. **Production Manager**
   - **Access level**: Read-only for all health data
   - **Primary needs**:
     - Health impact on production metrics
     - Treatment cost analysis
     - Mortality impact on biomass
   - **Contextual needs**:
     - Production planning integration
     - Health-related cost tracking

## Access Pattern Requirements

1. **Role-based access control**:
   - Veterinarians and QA: Full access to health module
   - Farm Operators: Limited data entry access
   - Managers: Read-only dashboard and reporting access

2. **Contextual visibility**:
   - Health data must be accessible both as a standalone app and integrated into batch/container views
   - Different levels of detail based on user role
   - Critical health alerts visible to all relevant roles

3. **Data entry workflows**:
   - Field operators need simple, focused interfaces for routine data collection
   - Veterinarians need comprehensive medical journal interfaces
   - QA personnel need structured sampling and parameter scoring interfaces

4. **Integration requirements**:
   - Health data must be linked to specific batches and containers
   - Environmental parameters should be correlated with health events
   - Treatment history should be accessible from batch views

## Key UI/UX Challenges

1. **Dual nature of health data**: Both specialized (for vets/QA) and contextual (for operators/managers)
2. **Varying technical expertise**: Users range from specialized veterinarians to field operators
3. **Mobile vs. desktop usage**: Field data collection vs. office-based analysis
4. **Complex relationships**: Health events may affect portions of batches across multiple containers
5. **Temporal importance**: Historical health data crucial for analysis and decision-making
