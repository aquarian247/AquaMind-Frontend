- Planning container transfers and space allocation
- Forecasting production volumes and timelines

**Design Validation:**
- ✅ Lifecycle visualization shows clear progression and timeline
- ✅ Container history tracking supports transfer planning
- ✅ Batch metrics (count, mortality, weight) support forecasting
- ✅ Feed history supports growth projections

### 5. Feed Manager

**Key Batch-Related Needs:**
- Monitoring feed usage across batches
- Planning feed type transitions
- Analyzing feed conversion ratios

**Design Validation:**
- ✅ Feed history chart shows feed type transitions
- ✅ Current feed details include FCR metrics
- ✅ Feed projections support planning
- ✅ Container-level feed data available

### 6. System Administrator

**Key Batch-Related Needs:**
- Ensuring data integrity across the batch lifecycle
- Managing user access to batch data
- System configuration for batch management

**Design Validation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive batch data model with clear relationships
- ✅ Role-based access controls implied in the design
- ✅ Consistent data structure across lifecycle stages

### 7. Executive (CEO, CFO)

**Key Batch-Related Needs:**
- High-level overview of batch performance
- Production forecasting
- Exception reporting for significant issues

**Design Validation:**
- ✅ Batch overview provides clear status visualization
- ✅ Lifecycle progression supports production forecasting
- ✅ Exception highlighting identifies significant issues
- ✅ Key metrics (mortality, growth) prominently displayed

## Design Requirements Validation

### Batch as Central Object

**Requirement:** Maintain batch as a central object while avoiding UI complexity

**Validation:**
- ✅ Batch-centric navigation with clear batch selection
- ✅ Tabbed interface separates complex information (medical, containers, feed)
- ✅ Visual indicators for container distribution reduce cognitive load
- ✅ Consistent batch context maintained across all views

### Lifecycle Progression

**Requirement:** Visualize progression through multiple lifecycle stages

**Validation:**
- ✅ Clear visual timeline showing all lifecycle stages
- ✅ Current stage highlighted with progress indicators
- ✅ Day count and remaining time estimates provided
- ✅ Historical container assignments tracked by stage

### Container Distribution

**Requirement:** Represent batch distribution across multiple containers

**Validation:**
- ✅ Visual container distribution in batch overview
- ✅ Detailed container grid with status indicators
- ✅ Container-specific metrics and alerts
- ✅ Historical container assignments tracked

### Medical Journal

**Requirement:** Support medical journal at both batch and container levels

**Validation:**
- ✅ Unified medical journal with container context
- ✅ Entry categorization (treatments, inspections, issues)
- ✅ Container-specific filtering capability
- ✅ Clear indication of affected containers for each entry

### Environmental Factors

**Requirement:** Track environmental factors affecting batches

**Validation:**
- ✅ Environmental metrics displayed in batch overview
- ✅ Container-specific environmental alerts
- ✅ Historical environmental data accessible
- ✅ Correlation between environmental factors and health issues

### Complete Traceability

**Requirement:** Maintain complete traceability throughout lifecycle

**Validation:**
- ✅ Comprehensive event timeline
- ✅ Container history tracking
- ✅ Feed type transitions recorded
- ✅ Medical events documented with container context

## Conclusion

The batch management design successfully addresses the requirements for maintaining the batch as a central object while providing clear visibility into its distribution across containers. The design supports the needs of all key personas while avoiding excessive UI complexity through:

1. Clear visual representation of lifecycle progression
2. Intuitive container distribution visualization
3. Tabbed interface separating complex information
4. Exception highlighting to focus attention on issues
5. Consistent batch context maintained across all views

The design maintains consistency with the overall AquaMind UI/UX system while introducing batch-specific components that address the unique challenges of batch management in aquaculture.
