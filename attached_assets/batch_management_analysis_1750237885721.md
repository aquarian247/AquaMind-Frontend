# AquaMind UI/UX Design Project - Batch Management

## Batch Management Analysis

### Key Characteristics of Batches
- Central object in the application
- 50-100 batches active at any time
- Progression through multiple lifecycle stages:
  - Egg/alevin stage (~90-100 days)
  - Parr stage (~90-100 days)
  - Smolt stage (~90-100 days)
  - Post-smolt stage (~90-100 days)
  - Adult stage (open sea/area, ~450 days)
- High mortality rate (20-25%) with significant variance
- Distributed across multiple containers
- Affected by environmental factors (O2, CO2, NO2, NO3, NH4, pH, salinity, temperature)
- Medical journal per batch, but treatments can differ by container
- Complete traceability required from egg to harvest

### Design Challenges
- Representing batch distribution across multiple containers
- Visualizing progression through lifecycle stages
- Tracking container-specific events while maintaining batch-level view
- Balancing comprehensive information with UI clarity
- Enabling efficient navigation between batch view and container view
- Supporting medical journal entries at both batch and container levels
